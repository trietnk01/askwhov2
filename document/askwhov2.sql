The in-person component of the project is the dark matter that helps us build resilience and thrive as a group. A lot of what I&#8217;m going to share applies to every WordPress event, whether it&#8217;s a meetup or workshop, a contributor day, any other sort of format. But I&#8217;ll be focused on WordCamps. It&#8217;s been a while since we had any in-person WordCamps. Our last two were WordCamp Malaga in Spain and WordCamp Greenville in the US. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped anyone from gathering people together online. Which honestly makes a lot of sense for WordPress. Because there are many reasons we gather, the main three reasons are connecting, inspiring, and contributing. It&#8217;s true. It says so right in our documentation, &#8220;paper rustling.&#8221; All WordPress events should connect WordPress users, inspire people to do more with WordPress, and contribute to the WordPress project. As an aside, I&#8217;ll tell you that some groups also get to collaborate and educate in there, but connect, inspire, contribute. Those are the big three. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about today. And if you subscribe to this podcast for the back office deep cuts, I&#8217;ll also have a few of those for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so first up, connect. WordCamps are generally annual-ish gatherings organized by local WordPress meetup groups. They&#8217;re not meant to be big or fancy. The definition of the minimum viable product for WordCamp is 50 people gathered all day to talk about WordPress. They are intentionally affordable to allow people from all walks of life to attend, meet, share and learn. This is made possible by donations and sponsorships from local businesses and larger businesses in the WordPress ecosystem. And this helps us get people connected to those in their community that works with or are sustained by WordPress. That connection feeds into the overall health of the global WordPress project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is inspire. WordCamps do not discriminate. They are open to any WordPress users, developers, designers, or other enthusiasts, regardless of their level of experience. And because of this, sessions generally span a variety of formats. So presentations or live demos to workshops or panels, any other format you can think of. But that also means that there are a variety of skill levels represented. There&#8217;s always content about how to use WordPress. That’s a given. But you can also count on content that inspires people to do more with their own dreams and aspirations. When I was still organizing WordCamps, my favorite thing was seeing people who came back year after year, putting into practice something that they learned the year before. It is that <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> aspect to WordCamps that lets people see the edge of their ideas and then expand that just a little bit further. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, contribute. WordCamps often have a contribution component to them. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a talk telling you how you can get more involved in the WordPress project. But sometimes, it&#8217;s a whole contributor day. And those range in size from single focus, like everyone, will show up and learn how to review a theme or a focus from every team that we have, like at the big flagship events where we gather hundreds of people into a room just to contribute to WordPress and all of the teams that go with it. Getting started with contributing can be daunting, but it is also essential to avoid something called the Tragedy of the Commons, an economic concept. So I&#8217;ll share a link to that in the show notes below. But the most important thing, the most important thing to remember, is that WordPress is open source. And we asked people to help us keep this great tool running by giving back a little bit of their time if they have gotten any benefit from the WordPress project or CMS over the course of their careers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s it. The three big things you can get from a WordCamp. I know that I can&#8217;t wait to get back to them myself because while a lot of these things can still happen online and do, it&#8217;s really hard to replace the dark matter of in-person connections for open source projects. And since we&#8217;re talking dark matter anyway, let&#8217;s dig into it a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the start of the section, I mentioned that WordCamps are local, locally organized, and people are encouraged to attend locally. But I am part of a group that ends up traveling to a lot of WordCamps. If you don&#8217;t know about the unseen work of WordPress, this raises eyebrows. So here is some clarification around the back office work that some of these traveling WordCampers often do. When I listed these out, there were about 20 different tasks, 20 different jobs, which was, frankly, a bit overwhelming when I listed them that way. So I&#8217;ve grouped them into kind of two genres, each with a group of current versus future types of work. So my two big buckets, big picture stuff, and then community stewardship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big picture stuff, our first big genre here, when you&#8217;re looking at current topics, current issues kind of information, when we&#8217;re working on big picture stuff, you get the clarification of the mission or vision of WordPress, the sharing of open source methods or processes that we use in the WordPress project, and also sometimes those goal-setting conversations that you have to have both because we have a bunch of teams and team reps, that have a lot of really great ideas about what can be done in their teams to help WordPress succeed. But then also, because when you are working, when you&#8217;re contributing to a single team in the project, it can sometimes be hard to know how your work relates to the overall goals and visions of WordPress. And so that&#8217;s part of the work that gets done that I do there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you&#8217;re looking at future topics, future issues, the second part of this genre, that stuff like starting conversations or discussions around what the future holds for WordPress, and that&#8217;s the project as well as the technology or hearing from people about big things coming up for them. And any content that can support it, anything that I can provide to support those big things. It&#8217;s also a good time for me and others to identify trends based on what I see in presentations or what I hear from people at social functions. Really, it&#8217;s just a huge opportunity for information gathering to make sure that I know what everyone else in the project is trying to do and if they understand what the project is trying to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second big genre of things that happen in that dark matter kind of work at WordCamps is what I call community stewardship—so taking care of the community itself for the project itself. And a lot of that work is actually incident response kind of work. So conflict resolution, mediation often happens at in-person events, but also uncovering the shared foundations, the shared understanding for upcoming changes. So a lot of really, in the weeds kind of change management work. And for me, it&#8217;s certainly doing my best as a cultural liaison when I do see that there has been some miscommunication or gathering context for the latest disagreement that people are having with me so that I can clarify anything that was misunderstood from what I said. And also a little bit of policy clarification, just explaining why we do things and the way we do them. So for community stewardship, that&#8217;s kind of the current stuff that we look at. And that I do when I&#8217;m traveling for WordCamps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for the future tasks that we do with community stewardship in the project, that stuff like training, and that&#8217;s training team reps, community deputies, or new contributors like it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not really one type of training, necessarily. But then also, all of the checking in with our organizers, team reps, volunteers, sponsors, everyone like that, to make sure that what we have in the project and what&#8217;s happening in the project, the tools that we have, the experience that contributors have while they are working here, and WordPress is good, and is what they need. We&#8217;ve got a lot of tools to get things done in WordPress, and we can always make them better. And so checking in with people to kind of see how those processes are, how the tools are making sure that I have an idea of where our holes are and what needs to be patched, and how we can patch them in the long run. So that&#8217;s all of the future planning kind of work and topic stuff, just you know, making sure that WordPress has what it needs to survive long into the future and long after I&#8217;m doing anything with it, and long after you&#8217;re doing anything with it either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, lots and lots of unseen work being done at our in-person events. But folks who keep a keen eye on the online global work of WordPress will probably recognize that a lot of that work is also done routinely on make.wordpress.org and within the making WordPress Slack. There’s just, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s just something different about receiving information from a human being with a face rather than an avatar with a photo. So I guess at the end of the day, that means the dark matter that keeps open source together is really an issue of communication. And you&#8217;ll get no arguments for me there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. And there&#8217;s really just one big thing. And that&#8217;s WordPress 5.8. We are about two weeks away from this big release; the community has been working tirelessly on it. And it&#8217;s shaping up to be one of the most tested releases that we&#8217;ve had in a long time. Myself, I&#8217;m grateful to see so much activity before the release. Since 5.8 and 5.9 releases represent such monumental shifts in our software, I&#8217;m incredibly grateful to see so much activity prior to the release, especially in the beta period. We&#8217;ve been testing everything for it feels like six or eight months, and we&#8217;re really starting to see the positive benefits of that. And I think that we, the WordPress community, should be really proud of everything that we&#8217;re going to ship in 2021. Okay, so that was less of a small list of big things and really like one big thing with a generous garnish of encouragement, but you deserve it. So thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"10889\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"The Month in WordPress: June 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 15:11:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10896\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:334:\"Once you step into contribution time, your main concern is the users of WordPress, or new contributors, or the health of the WordPress ecosystem as a whole or the WordPress project.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:40</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, we hosted WordCamp Europe and had the double pleasure of a demo that showed us a bit about the future of WordPress and an interview that looked back while also looking a bit forward. If you haven&#8217;t seen the demo, it was beautiful. And I&#8217;ve included a link to it in the show notes. And if you haven&#8217;t heard the interview, there were a few specific moments that I&#8217;d like to take the time to delve into a little more. Brian Krogsgard, in his conversation with Matt Mullenweg, brought up three really interesting points. I mean, he brought up a lot of interesting points, but there were three that I would particularly like to look into today. The first was about balance. The second was about cohesion. And the third was about those we leave behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 01:24</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So first is this question of balance. Brian brought this up in the context of the overall economic health of the WordPress ecosystem. And in that particular moment, he talked about companies that are coming together, companies that are merging. And in Matt&#8217;s answer, the part that I found the most interesting was when he said, &#8220;the point at which there is the most commercial opportunity is also the point at which there is the most opportunity for short-termism. He went on to talk about the importance of long-term thinking and collective thinking about what makes us, and us here means probably the WordPress project, more vibrant and vital in 10 or 20 or 30 years. One of the things that he specifically called out in that answer was the responsibility of larger companies in the ecosystem. For instance, like Automattic, to commit fully to giving back, there are many ways now that companies can give back to WordPress so that we all replenish the Commons. They can pay for volunteer contributors&#8217; time; they can create and sponsor entire teams through the Five for the Future program. They can contribute time through our outreach program. And they can even contribute to WordPress&#8217;s ability to own our own voice by engaging their audience&#8217;s awareness of what&#8217;s next in WordPress, or whatever. And I know this balance, this particular balance of paid contributors or sponsored contributors, compared to our volunteer contributors or self-sponsored contributors; I know that this balance is one that people keep an eagle eye on. I am consistently on a tight rope to appropriately balanced those voices. But as with so many things where balance is key, keeping an eye on the middle or the long-distance can really help us get it right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 03:23</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second question was one of cohesion and specifically cohesion over the competition. Brian asked how, if people feel disadvantaged, you can foster a feeling of cohesion rather than competition? And Matt&#8217;s first answer was that competition is great. Specifically, he said that competition is great as long as you consider where your collaboration fits into the mission. And he also spent some time exploring how competitors in the ecosystem can still work from a community-first mindset. I personally cannot agree enough about some of the benefits of collaboration alongside your competitors. I remind sponsored contributors from time to time, and I think it&#8217;s true for any contributor that you are an employee of your company first and a contributor to WordPress second. However, once you step into contribution time, your main concern is the users of WordPress, or new contributors, or the health of the WordPress ecosystem as a whole or the WordPress project. So you get all this subject matter expertise from competitive forces, collaborating in a very us versus the problem way. And when you do that, you&#8217;re always going to find a great solution. It may not be as fast as you want it to build things out in the open in public. And so sometimes we get it wrong and have to come back and fix it but still, given time, we&#8217;re going to come out with the best solution because we have so many skilled people working on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 05:01</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third question that I wanted to really touch on is the question of those we leave behind. Brian asked Matt if he thought mid-sized agencies and mid-sized consultants were being squeezed out with the block editor. Matt&#8217;s high-level answer was no, and I tend to agree with him. It&#8217;s not all mid-sized anything any more than it&#8217;s all small-sized anything. His answer continued to look at what stands to change for users with the block editor and who really can stand to benefit. It made me think back to my WordPress 5.0 listening tour. We launched WordPress 5.0, which was, in case anyone forgets, the first release with the block editor in it. I took a six-month-long tour to anywhere that WordPressers were so I could hear their main worries, what Brian is saying in there, and what Matt is saying to really came up all the time in those conversations. And basically, it was that this update takes all the power away from people who are building websites. And in these conversations, and Matt and Brian&#8217;s conversation, it was really focused on our freelancers and consultants. But at the same time, all of them heard that this update gives power back to all of the people who could build websites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 06:28</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could not shake the feeling at the time. And honestly, I can&#8217;t shake it now that no high-end consultants, or freelancers, or any other developer or site creator sit around just longing for maintenance work. After six months of talking to people, I didn&#8217;t hear anyone say, &#8220;you know, I just love making the same author card over and over and over.&#8221; Or, &#8220;updated the footer every week, this month. And that&#8217;s why I got into this business.&#8221; And more than the feeling that there just wasn&#8217;t anyone who just loved maintenance, I got a feeling that there were real problems that needed to be solved for these clients and that they wanted to solve them. And that they also would gladly trade updating footers for the much more interesting work of creating modern and stylish business hubs based on WordPress for the clients who trust them so much. All of that, I guess, is to say that, yes, the block editor does give power back to our clients again, but not at the expense of those who have to build the sites in the first place. I think it stands to restore everyone&#8217;s sense of agency more than we truly realize. So that&#8217;s my deep dive on WordCamp Europe; I included links to the demo and the talk below, just in case you haven&#8217;t seen them yet. And you want to get a little bit of insight into the full context of the conversations that I just did a bit of a deep dive into.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 08:15</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. All right, I have three things for you today. Number one, tomorrow, we package WordPress 5.8 beta three. If you&#8217;ve never had a chance to stop by the core channel in slack for the past packaging process, I really encourage you to stop by; we call them release parties. It&#8217;s a bunch of people who stand around and help get it done. So you can also see how it gets done. And if you&#8217;re feeling brave, you can even try your hand at testing out one of the packages as soon as it&#8217;s ready. The second thing is that a week from tomorrow, we reach our first release candidate milestone. So if you have meant to submit any bugs or patches or if you&#8217;ve been procrastinating on documentation, or dev notes, right now is the time so that we can have a chance to get everything into the release by the time we reach the release candidate milestone on the 29th. And the third thing is that we are currently right in the middle of WordCamp Japan. That is a great opportunity to meet some contributors and maybe even get started with contributions yourself.

Let&#8217;s start with some highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Powerful Blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Discover several new blocks and expressive tools, including blocks for&nbsp;<em>Page Lists</em>,&nbsp;<em>Site Title</em>,&nbsp;<em>Logo</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Tagline</em>. A powerful&nbsp;<em>Query Loop</em>&nbsp;block offers multiple ways for displaying lists of posts and comes with new block patterns that take advantage of its flexibility and creative possibilities.</li><li>Interacting with nested blocks has been made easier with a permanent toolbar button for selecting a parent. Block outlines are shown when hovering or focusing on the different block type buttons. Block handles are now also present for drag and drop when in “select” mode.</li><li>Introduces the&nbsp;<strong>List View</strong>, a panel that can be toggled and helps navigate complex blocks and patterns.</li><li>Reusable blocks have an improved creation flow and support for history revisions. </li><li>A cool new duotone block adds images effects which can be used in media blocks or supported in third-party blocks. Color presets can also be customized by the theme.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Handpicked Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns can now also be recommended and selected during block setup, offering powerful new flows.

I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone who has ever organized something, whether it&#8217;s a social event, a school project, or an annual family gathering, you know that there are many different opinions. The more opinions you have, the more likely people don&#8217;t see eye to eye. And before you know it, you&#8217;ve got some disagreements. Some things make disagreements worse, like imbalance of information, lack of showing your work, and sometimes just “too many cooks in the kitchen,” to use a regional phrase. Frankly, sometimes it seems like the second you have more than one cook in your kitchen, you&#8217;re going to get some disagreements. But I think that&#8217;s a healthy thing. WordPress is huge. And there are huge numbers of people contributing to WordPress or any other open source project you want to name. So there&#8217;s a lot of stuff available to disagree about. If we never saw anyone pointing out an area that wasn&#8217;t quite right, there would probably be something wrong. If you, like me, think that a healthy tension of collaborative disagreement can be useful when approached thoughtfully, then this quick start guide is for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step one, prepare to host a discussion. This is, by the way, just the hardest step out there. You have to take a little time to figure out what problem you&#8217;re solving with the solution you&#8217;re suggesting, any goals that it relates to, and then figure out what the bare minimum best outcome would be and what the wildest dreams magic wand waving outcome would be. And you have to be honest with yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step two, host the discussion. The venue will be different for different discussions, but you see a lot of these on team blogs or within the actual tickets where work is being done. Wherever you&#8217;re hosting it, state the problem, state your idea for the solution and ask for what you missed. If you&#8217;re hosting a discussion in person, like in a town hall format, this can be hard. And generally, hosting discussions in an in-person or voice call or zoom call kind of way is hard. So if you have an opportunity to start doing this in text first and level your way up to in person, that&#8217;s my recommendation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step three is to summarize the discussion and post a decision if possible. So organizing a big discussion into main points is a really good practice for the people you&#8217;re summarizing it for and yourself. It helps you to confirm your understanding, and it also gives you the chance to pair other solutions with the problem and goals you outlined in step one. If a different solution solves the same problem but with less time or effort, it&#8217;s worth taking a second look with less time or effort. There’s something that I say to WordPress contributors frequently, and that is there are a lot of yeses. There are a lot of right ways to do things and only a few clear wrong ways to do things. So be open-minded about whether or not someone else&#8217;s right way to do things could still achieve the goals you&#8217;re trying to accomplish with your solution. A note on step three where I said, “and post the decision if possible.” Sometimes you&#8217;re the person to make that decision, but sometimes you are not the person who can give something the green light, and so you&#8217;re preparing a recommendation. Whether you&#8217;re making a decision or a recommendation, sometimes you may experience a little decision-making paralysis. I know I do. So here are a few of the tools that I use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re avoiding the decision, use the 10/10/10 rule; it can help you figure out if you&#8217;re stuck on a short-term problem. If there are too many good choices, use the Eisenhower Matrix that can help you to prioritize objectively. If there are too many bad choices, use the Maximin strategy. It can help you to identify how to minimize any potential negative impacts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so you&#8217;ve considered your position. You’ve discussed everything. You summarized the big points. Maybe you also worked your way through to a recommendation or a decision. What about everyone who disagreed with the decision? Or have you made a recommendation, and it wasn&#8217;t accepted? How do you deal with that? That&#8217;s where “disagree and commit” shows up. This phrase was made popular by the folks over at Amazon, I think. But it first showed up, I believe at Sun Microsystems as this phrase, “agreeing, commit, disagree and commit or get out of the way.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disagree and commit as a concept works pretty well when everyone agrees on the vision and the goals, but not necessarily how to get to those goals. We&#8217;ve had moments in recent history where folks we&#8217;re not able to agree, we’re not able to commit, and so then left the project. I hate when that happens. I want people to thrive in this community for the entire length of their careers. But I also understand that situation shows up in the top five learnings of open source when you no longer have interest in the project and handed it off to a competent successor. So there it is &#8211; disagreements in open source in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with so many of the things I discuss on this podcast, this is incredibly complex and nuanced in practice. Taking an argument, distilling facts from feelings, and adjusting frames of reference until the solution is well informed and risk-balanced. That is a skill set unto itself. But one that increases the health of any organization. I’ll share that list of references and general materials in the show notes, including a link explaining each of those decision-making tools that I shared. I&#8217;m also going to include the contributor training module on decision-making in the WordPress project. It&#8217;s got excellent information. It&#8217;s part of a series of modules that I asked team reps to take and sponsored contributors. I don&#8217;t require it from anyone, but I do hope that it is useful for you. Also, speaking of useful for you, if you are just here for leadership insights, I included some hot takes after the outro music for you. It&#8217;s like an Easter egg, but I just told you about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us to our small list of big things! First off, WordCamp Europe is happening this we; I hope that everybody has an opportunity to attend. If you still haven&#8217;t gotten your tickets, they are free, and I think there are still a few left. I will include a link in the show notes as well. There&#8217;s going to be a little demo with Matt Mullenweg and Matias Ventura on the WordPress 5.8 release that&#8217;s coming up. And then kind of a retrospective discussion between Matt and Brian Krogsgard. I encourage you to join; I think it&#8217;s going to be very interesting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also WordCamp, Japan coming up June 20 through 26th. I mentioned it last time &#8211;&nbsp; it has a big section of contributing and contribution time. So if you&#8217;re looking to get started, some projects are laid out, and I encourage you to take a look at that as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new thing on this list, and I don&#8217;t know how new It is, in general, I hope it&#8217;s not too new to you, is that WordPress 5.8 release is reaching its beta one milestone on June 8th, so right in the middle of WordCamp Europe. I encourage every single theme developer, plugin developer that we have, agency owners that we have to really take a look at this release and dig into testing it. It&#8217;s a gigantic release. And I have so many questions about what will work and will not work once we get it into a broader testing area. We&#8217;ve been doing a lot of testing in the outreach program. But it&#8217;s always helpful to get people who are using WordPress daily in their jobs to really give a good solid test to the beta product to the beta package. And put it all through its paces for us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey there, you must be here because I told you about this totally not hidden easter egg about my hot takes on organizational health; I have three for you. And if you&#8217;ve ever worked with me, none of this will surprise you. But if you haven&#8217;t worked with me, hopefully, it kind of gives you some idea about how I approach all of this a bit differently. So, number one, critical feedback is the sign of a healthy organization. And I will never be dissuaded from that opinion. A complete lack of dissent doesn&#8217;t look like “alignment.” To me, that looks like fear. And it goes against the open source idea that many eyes make all bugs shallow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tip number two, a bit of tension is good, a bit of disagreement is good. The same thing that I say about women in tech, we&#8217;re not all the same. And if we were, then we wouldn&#8217;t need to collaborate anyway. But diversity, whether that&#8217;s the diversity of thought or of a person or of experience, just doesn&#8217;t happen without some misunderstandings. It&#8217;s how we choose to grow through those misunderstandings that make all the difference for the type of organization we are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And hot take number three, changing your mind isn&#8217;t flip-flopping or hypocritical. I think that&#8217;s a sign of growth and willingness to hear others. I like to think of my embarrassment at past bad decisions &#8211; as the sore muscles of a learning brain. And I, again, probably won&#8217;t be dissuaded from that opinion. Although, you know, if I&#8217;m sticking true to changing your mind some flip-flopping or hypocritical, maybe I will, but you can always try to, to give me the counter-argument for that, and we&#8217;ll see how it goes.

She first explored content creation and design before focusing on SEO and becoming an independent specialist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana was hired as a Customer Happiness Engineer for a hosting company, where she discovered the benefits of having a team. She realized that having close working relationships with colleagues is helpful for business success and accelerates personal growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana hopes that by sharing her story, she can help others who are either starting their career or are moving roles. She describes the opportunities she discovered in the WordPress community as ‘a huge epiphany’, especially in the world of freelancing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She highlights <strong>5 things that helped her to start a new freelancing career</strong>. Let’s dive into them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What motivates me?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“Why am I doing this?” is the first question that Tijana asks herself before starting anything new. This self-review and honesty, she feels, allows her to determine her priorities. She also benchmarks options around her motivations of wanting a flexible schedule and to grow professionally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She lists the reasons to make a particular choice, like being a freelancer, to help her choose the right job, pathway, or identify alternatives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She recommends that others can take a similar approach. If freelancing is still the best solution after examining all their goals and motivations, Tijana believes a good next step would be to learn WordPress-related skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cdHeIL-H_mE6QFCUxUT-gfKS2GzizRHtn4iCENoaWOimC82BfModRJh44QbhvHPW0GNVP5eUPhgxQteDRbA_9EUzpssTXMGWje1hUuKyrfXUgGhCnvXQdraaUQiaGBjFr73dNYxr\" alt=\"WordCamp Europe 2019 group picture\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Develop WordPress related skills</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question you may ask: “Why WordPress?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is used by more than 40% of websites in some form and offers various roles, many of which are not developer-specific. Tijana highlights a few:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>web developer (coding websites, themes, and plugins)</li><li>web implementor (creating websites from existing themes without coding)</li><li>web designer (designing website mock-ups, editing images, or creating online infographics)</li><li>client support professional (helping people with their websites)</li><li>website maintenance (WordPress, themes, and plugins are maintained and backed up regularly)</li><li>WordPress trainer (helping clients with how to use the platform or teaching other web professionals)</li><li>content writer</li><li>accessibility specialist (making sure standards are met and suggesting solutions for accessibility barriers)</li><li>SEO consultant (improving search outcomes and understanding)</li><li>statistics consultant, especially for web shops</li><li>WordPress assistant (adding new content and editing existing posts)</li><li>website migration specialist (moving websites from one server to another)</li><li>web security specialist</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/16XExYT_P4R4PX3orOaWbueDfkBIA6PFQ-CuYEXdeN9AvUIuIF33aIjT1DpdnFCqhrijWv1f68OR2Qh14xGT9REHGJ-MqK-OxJ9XcrhZ3IkcW8DBI7nVAtvFcCnCHL0woka_FV6t\" alt=\"WCBGD group picture\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana emphasized: “Another reason why WordPress is great for freelancers is the strong community that exists around this content management system (CMS).&#8221; WordCamps and Meetups are a way to get useful information and meet people from a large and very diverse community and get answers to many questions straight away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past year, these events have been primarily online. However, the contributors who run them continue to make an effort to provide an experience as close to in-person events as possible. The biggest advantage to online events is that we can attend events from across the world, even if sometimes during these difficult times, it is difficult to get enough time to deeply into this new experience. Since Tijana’s first Meetup, she has attended many WordPress community events and volunteered as a speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plan in advance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Becoming a freelancer takes time. For Tijana, success came with proper planning and following her plan to ‘acquire or improve relevant skills that will make you stand out in the freelance market.’ She strongly believes that learning and growing as a professional opens more business opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering a freelance career, she advises improving relevant skills or developing new skills related to your hobbies as ‘there is nothing better than doing what you love.’ In cases where no previous experience and knowledge can be used, she suggests choosing ‘a job that has a shorter learning curve and builds your knowledge around that.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana started as a content creator and learned to become an SEO expert. However, she highlights many alternative paths, including starting as a web implementer and moving to train as a developer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She suggests to others: “It would be a good idea to analyze the market before you jump into the learning process.” She also recommends people check the latest trends and consider the future of the skills they are developing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit the new <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress.org</a> to see what topics are of interest to you. In this newly established resource, the WordPress community aggregates workshops to support those who want to start and improve their skills, provides lesson plans for professional WordPress trainers and helps you create personal learning to develop key skills. There is also material on helping you be part of and organize events for your local community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana highlights that there are many places for freelancers to find clients. For example, the WordPress Community has a place where companies and individual site owners publish their job advertisements&nbsp; &#8211; <a href=\"https://jobs.wordpress.net/\">Jobs.WordPress.net</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hurray, it’s time to get a first freelancing job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a pragmatic person, Tijana recommends: “Save money before quitting your job to become a full-time freelancer. Alternatively, try freelancing for a few hours per week to see if you like it. Although some people do benefit when taking a risk, think twice before you take any irreversible actions.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She shared some possible next steps:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>use a freelancing platform</li><li>triple-check your resume</li><li>professionally present yourself</li><li>fill up your portfolio with examples</li><li>use video material</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“By using video material, your clients will not see you like a list of skills and previous experiences, but as a real person that has these skills and experiences and that provides a certain service for them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She adds: “Have a detailed strategy when choosing your first employer. Choose your first employer wisely, very wisely. I can’t emphasize enough how important this is”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Tijana took her first freelancing job, she considered the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>how was the employer rated by other freelancers who worked for him previously</li><li>how does the employer rate other freelancers</li><li>how much money had they already spent on the platform</li><li>the number of open positions for a specific job and the number of freelancers that have already applied&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“The first job is not all about the money. Don’t get greedy on your first job. If you get good recommendations, your second job can pay two to three times more. And your third job can go up to five times more. That was my experience.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Take responsibility as a freelancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana reminds us: “Freedom often comes with responsibility; individual responsibility is key when it comes to freelancing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She advises others not to take a job if you can not make a deadline and have someone reliable who can help you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Missing deadlines will cost your client money and affect the review the client will be willing to leave about your job, and this can have a big impact on your future opportunities or freelance jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She adds: “This can start a downward spiral for your career. However, we are all humans, and unpredictable things can happen. If for some reason you are not able to complete your work in a timely manner, let your client know immediately so they can have enough time to hire someone else”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana emphasizes the importance of making expectations clear before accepting a job, both what the client is expecting and what you can expect from the client.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, she points out that if you are working from home, your friends and family should treat you the way they would if you were in an office. She advises: “Let them know about your working schedule.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She hopes that these basic guidelines will be useful in launching freelance careers, as they did her, even though there is no universal recipe for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana highlights: “It’s just important to stay focused on your goals and to be open to new opportunities.” Freelancing wasn’t the only way she could have fulfilled her goals, but it was an important part of her path, and it helped her be confident in her abilities to make the next big step in her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, she was missing close relationships with colleagues and teamwork, which she has now found in her current firm. Her colleagues describe her as a: “walking-talking bundle of superpowers: sports medicine and fitness professional, SEO expert, blogger, designer and a kitty foster mum”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PIGT9R6FmtEHsNBvWzyViW5htRAm156asTOsohOGOUwfsWjW1TuDhUI9yuZnjIe-1eFHfFUWPULPtw82P3YYXHa0bsY_jA5keelmDHfSkTdd3xUsVZTmG9KvdE8XTojvU3LxYCsi\" alt=\"Conference reception\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering starting your career as a freelancer, take the courses offered at <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">learn.wordpress.org,</a> reach out to companies that you would be interested in working with, and remember that there are a whole host of opportunities in the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">The WordPress.org Teams</a> &#8211; what they do, when and where they meet</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress resource</a> &#8211; free to use to expand your knowledge and skills of using the platform and learning about the community around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3-day <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp Europe 2021</a> online event begins on 7 June 2021.

From the block toolbar, use the filter button and choose a preset:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/05/duotone_howto.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also choose colors from your theme’s palette, or a custom color of your choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the image block, duotone can be applied to both images and video in the cover block.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/06/waves-a60072-67ff66.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will This Overwrite Images in My Media Library?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Images and videos in your media library will remain unchanged. The duotone effect works using <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/filters.html\">SVG filters</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects-1/\">CSS filter property</a>, so the image or video is never modified in your library. On the one hand, this means that you can apply a filter to an image that you link to that doesn’t exist in your media library. On the other hand, this means that the filter won’t show up in RSS feeds or places that use the image URL directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can I Add Duotone Colors to Blocks or Themes That I Develop?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The API for adding duotone colors to blocks is experimental in Gutenberg v10.6. Still, the documentation for using it in your own blocks can be found and will be updated under <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-supports/#color\">Supports Color</a> in the Block Editor Handbook. Themes can add duotone presets with theme.json. More information can be found under <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/#presets\">Global Settings &amp; Styles Presets</a> in the Block Editor Handbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Try it Out Now Using the Gutenberg plugin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The duotone feature was released in version 10.6 of the Gutenberg plugin, so you can try it out now prior to the WordPress 5.8 release in July.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/joen/\">@joen</a> and <em><em><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mkaz/\">@mkaz</a></em></em></em> <em>for assistance writing and reviewing this post.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"10349\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"WP Briefing: Episode 9: The Cartography of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/episode-9-the-cartography-of-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 24 May 2021 11:55:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"wp-briefing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=10373\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:159:\"In this episode, Josepha Haden Chomphosy provides a map of how to navigate WordPress teams and communication channels, along with her small list of big things.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:9:\"enclosure\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:3:\"url\";s:62:\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/05/WP-Briefining-009.mp3\";s:6:\"length\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"type\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12611:\"\n<p>In this episode, Josepha Haden Chomphosy provides a map of how to navigate WordPress teams and communication channels, along with her small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost every episode of this podcast, you can hear me invite you to join in the WordPress project, to contribute back, to get involved. And I&#8217;m sure that every time I say that there&#8217;s at least one of you who&#8217;s like “Yes. Challenge accepted!” And you wade in sight unseen, to immerse yourselves in the cheerful cacophony of open source at scale that is WordPress. You see before you all 158 ways you can start contributing and you are exhilarated by this lostness. This you think, is the lostness of infinite possibility. And for you, I&#8217;m really thankful. My work here today would not be possible if it weren&#8217;t for the brave souls who leap into something with hope as their primary plan and tactic. You are heroes, and I thank you very much for your service. For everyone else, I&#8217;m going to give you a quick tour of where WordPress collaborates and a little bit of how they collaborate. We&#8217;ll cover the Make network, the Making WordPress Slack, events for WordPress, and a rundown of the teams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the Make network. The Make network of sites can be found at make.wordpress.org. That page includes information on most of our teams. Teams like Core and Design and Community. All of those teams require some technical skills since we&#8217;re a project built around a piece of software. However, some require a little more than others. You can think of this set of sites as the desk of each team in the WordPress project. It&#8217;s where they update each other, where they host discussions, where they refine proposals, and where they coordinate admin tasks. Contributors can write posts on most sites in the network as long as they follow the guidelines and best practices. And anyone with a wordpress.org profile can join in discussions in the comments. Most work on the Make network is asynchronous, and discussions stay open for a long enough time to allow anyone in the world to weigh in when they have the time. It&#8217;s how we try to remember that we are a globally-minded project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second area is the Making WordPress Slack instance. The Making WordPress Slack instance can be found at wordpress.slack.com, and it requires an account that is associated with your wordpress.org profile. Each team in the project has a channel, although not all channels in that Slack instance, represent a standalone team. You can think of this Slack instance as a set of conference rooms. It&#8217;s where contributors connect, gain a more nuanced understanding of problems that we&#8217;re trying to solve. They host synchronous meetings and also coordinate working groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors can post in most channels, although there are a few that are restricted. We don&#8217;t have any social channels in this Slack instance, but most WordPress-ers do tend to find friends that they connect with. The work done here is synchronous, and most meetings last about an hour. There are about 35+ meetings a week, so you can basically always find someone around.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last area we work is actually at WordPress events. Word Camps and WordPress meetups happen all over the world. Unless there&#8217;s a global pandemic, then they&#8217;re kind of all over the computer and at all times of day and night. You can keep track of those on wordcamp.org or on WordPress’s meetup page, which I&#8217;ve linked in the notes below. These events bring together all sorts of facets of the WordPress project. And they are an event where local WordPress communities aim to connect, inspire and educate each other. There&#8217;s always someone at these events, who knows a little bit more about WordPress than you do. If you&#8217;re headed to want to learn more about contribution, look out for any that have a contributor day or are hosting a contribution drive. These are clearly synchronous events. And when we do get back to doing them in person, they&#8217;re also tied to physical locations. When we get back to them, I encourage you to find one that&#8217;s close to you. They are incredibly valuable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so that&#8217;s the map of the area. Those are the three big places where we get this stuff done. Let&#8217;s do a quick map of the teams themselves. If you&#8217;re a developer and you&#8217;re looking to work inside the technology space, work with code a bit, then your best chances for teams are Core and all of its related components. They&#8217;re like 50 components, including core editor and various other things. There&#8217;s also the Mobile team WP CLI, the Tide team, Security, our brand new team, Openverse, and Meta. Those all take a fairly high amount of code knowledge to contribute there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re more into design and product work, then we have a few teams for that as well. There&#8217;s of course, the Design team, but we also have Accessibility, Test, Triage, Polyglots kind of falls in there for me. But if you are a programs person, and we&#8217;re talking like programs, getting people together programs, not programs, as in programming or code. So if you&#8217;re a programs person, you&#8217;re looking more at the Community team, at the Themes team, the Plugin team, Polyglots, again, Training support, probably a number of others that have like program components in it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are really interested in learning more about contributor experience, which is how we build tools, and again, programs for all of the contributors who are showing up, then the teams for you will be teams like Meta and Documentation, Hosting, the Community team, the Training team, arguably any team that has a program as part of it is considered contributor experience because that&#8217;s how we help our contributors know what to do, what not to do, how to help them get onboarded, find their way, stuff like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re more in the communications area of things, we have quite a few teams there as well. We do have Marketing, of course, but also I think that Support ends up in our communications area, WordPress TV, obviously ends up in communications. But I think Training, Meta, Documentation, and arguably, maybe also Testing ends up in that space as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realize that there are a handful of teams that I mentioned multiple times, especially Polyglots, Support, Test, Triage, Meta, Community. The reason they end up in a number of different places is that all of those teams also have a fair amount of admin and infrastructure stuff that goes into the WordPress project and community as a whole. So it touches a lot of other teams, and so they get a lot of mentions. All right. So WordPress adventurers, you now have a beginner&#8217;s map. I hope it helps, and I hope we see you around the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re still with me, that brings us today to my small list of big things. I&#8217;ve got four things for you, and I&#8217;m excited about all of them. The first two are events actually. WordCamp Europe is coming up from June seventh through the ninth. It will include a presentation from the WordPress project co-founder, Matt Mullenweg, so I encourage you to hop over, grab a ticket to check out the rest of the sessions that are happening while you&#8217;re there. The next one is WordCamp, Japan, which is happening June 20th through the 26th. And you heard that right that is seven whole days of WordCamp. It&#8217;s a little bit of a different format than we normally take, but it&#8217;s five days actually of contribution on ten specific projects. Then that&#8217;s bookended on either side of those contribution days, with full days of sessions. There&#8217;s some in English, but it&#8217;s primarily in Japanese. But either way, I think it&#8217;s going to be a really excellent event, and I encourage everyone to check it out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of my list is not events. We have opened our sixth call for testing, it&#8217;s specifically looking at the template editing mode for Full Site Editing. It is an iteration on one of our earliest tests for the Full Site Editing outreach program. And so it has incorporated a lot of the feedback that we got in that test the first time around. So if you look at that test, which by the way, are all guided, if you&#8217;ve never tested anything before, don&#8217;t let this scare you. It&#8217;s really well written, it&#8217;s got a good guide on it and, and also allows for a little bit of exploration. But if you participated in the landing page test that we did early on, this is the follow-up to that. It incorporates a lot of the feedback that we got, so this is closing that feedback loop and I encourage you to stop by and participate in that test. It will be linked in the show notes and also I tweet about it a bit so you can run over there and find it also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;WordPress is dropping support for Internet Explorer 11. That&#8217;s happening over the summer, so around the middle of July is when that&#8217;s going to happen. If you&#8217;ve been using WordPress for a while you&#8217;ve been getting notifications. If you happen to get to WordPress with IE11, letting you know that that this particular browser is reaching the end of its life for support in general on the web, but now WordPress also is making the choice to drop support for that. And so there&#8217;s a post out on wordpress.org/news, which I will also link to in the show notes in case you have not heard about this yet. It shouldn&#8217;t have any immediate and noticeable effects on anyone who&#8217;s visiting a site that&#8217;s built using WordPress. There might be a few things in the dashboard that don&#8217;t work if you are administering a WordPress site from IE11. So there&#8217;s a lot of good information in that post. Give it a read and if you have questions, always feel free to stop by the Core chat and ask those as we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks!</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"10373\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Dropping support for Internet Explorer 11\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/dropping-support-for-internet-explorer-11/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 May 2021 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10369\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:337:\"Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) was released over 7 years ago and is currently used by less than 1% of all users on the Internet with usage rapidly declining.

IE11 users have been shown a warning that IE11 is considered outdated in the WordPress dashboard for the last 17+ months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are already using one of the more modern browsers above, you will only be positively impacted by this change, as there are performance benefits to dropping IE11 support. However, if any other users of your site are still using IE11, it’s possible they will be affected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does “dropping support” mean?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When support for a browser is removed from WordPress, new features are no longer tested on those browsers and are not guaranteed to function optimally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automated tools that generate parts of the WordPress Core source code are also updated to exclude unsupported browsers. This means that any feature relying on these generated files will likely have bugs or stop working for users of those browsers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor will be the area of WordPress most heavily impacted by this change because almost all of the files related to the block editor are compiled using these automated tools. Other areas of the WordPress dashboard also use CSS built with these tools and their appearance will potentially be impacted when using IE11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All other areas of the code base that are IE11 specific will need to be identified, evaluated, and removed on a case-by-case basis as the rest are manually maintained. This process will begin in the WordPress 5.9 release, and will likely happen gradually over several major releases. Additionally, any bugs which are reported for IE11 will not be fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How will this affect themes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No changes will be made to any of the default bundled themes as a result of this plan. No code related to IE11 support (or any other browser that may have been supported when each theme was released) will be removed from default themes. However, any new features added going forward will not be tested in IE11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are not using a default theme, it’s still unlikely that your theme will be affected by this change. Themes typically have their own browser support policies, and changes in WordPress Core do not affect those. It’s possible that your theme author may have removed support for IE11 already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If IE11 support is important to you and you are unsure whether your theme supports IE11, it is recommended that you reach out to your theme’s developer to confirm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More information on this change can be found on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/04/22/ie-11-support-phase-out-plan/\">Making WordPress Core blog</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"10369\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"WordPress 5.7.2 Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/wordpress-5-7-2-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 May 2021 01:04:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10334\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:356:\"WordPress 5.7.2 is now available.

Wayfinder outlines each block in the editor on hover. It then displays the block name at the upper left of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite feature that you will not find elsewhere is the addition of each block&rsquo;s classes at the bottom right of the box. This makes it easy for designers or users who want to quickly find a class for styling.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Outline of a Heading block.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can also enable or disable the pieces of the UI they want to appear via the plugin&rsquo;s setting screen. However, any changes affect all of the site&rsquo;s user experiences. Currently, there are no per-user settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, the plugin seemed to work great. The hover outline experience felt smooth, and I did not need to change the default options. Wayfinder almost seemed to be everything one might look for in a block-outline solution. It was besting existing plugins in nearly every way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, things soon began rolling downhill when writing a typical blog post with nothing other than Heading, Paragraph, and Image blocks. I first noticed that I could not type the same number of words as usual on one line. My perfectly-tuned typography was breaking sooner than it should have. Spacing between paragraphs seemed a bit too large. My wide-aligned images were just a little smaller than usual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user experience still felt good until this point, but the little oddities were stacking up. Something was not right. The plugin had been showered with praise on Twitter and already received three five-star reviews in its first 24 hours. Maybe my custom theme was the issue. However, similar problems arose when testing several others, such as Twenty Twenty-One, Nutmeg, and Eksell &mdash; each a well-rounded theme catered to the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As clean as the plugin&rsquo;s UI is, it more often than not wrecks the theme&rsquo;s default block spacing. This becomes more noticeable as users begin adding nested layers of blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is the plugin adds 18 pixels of padding around every block via its stylesheet.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>.wp-block:not(.block-list-appender) {\n    position: relative;\n    outline: 1px dashed transparent;\n    <strong>padding: 18px;</strong>\n    overflow: visible !important;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To the untrained eye, this may not be a visible issue in many cases. It will affect each site differently, but 18 pixels of extra padding on every block will undoubtedly mess things up to some degree unless the theme itself uses that exact same spacing in its design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more noticeable issues are seen with blocks like Social Icons:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Holy moly! Those are some gigantic social icons!\n\n\n\n<p>But, even something as basic as a List block can be misaligned:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />List block shifted out of alignment.\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors can write custom CSS to overrule the plugin&rsquo;s padding. However, the last thing the WordPress community needs is a specificity war between themes and plugins. Themers already have to do this enough to wrangle blocks now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Removing that one <code>padding</code> rule from the plugin&rsquo;s <code>editor-style.css</code> killed 99% of its issues. Afterward, things were running like a well-oiled machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a developer, I would explore <code><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-offset\">outline-offset</a></code> for spacing between the block and its outline, maybe cutting that <code>18px</code> down a bit. Because outlines are not a part of the CSS box model, it would not affect spacing. Adjustments may be necessary on a per-block basis, especially when those blocks are nested or small (e.g., Social Icons, Navigation). It would carry its own challenges but should be a less destructive course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To a lesser extent, the plugin&rsquo;s <code>overflow</code> rule breaks the theme design from time to time. Its <code>position</code> and <code>outline</code> rules could overrule some edge-case block styles too, but they are necessary for the plugin to actually do its job. In particular, I could see positioning being problematic with sticky headers as we get into site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only other issue might be themes that use <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements on blocks, but the plugin also needs to overwrite those to display the block name and classes list. This is likely another edge case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the issues, the plugin is ahead of the pack at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/editor-blocks-border/\">Gutenberg Editor Full Width Blocks Border</a> (<em>a bit of a mouthful</em>), another recent plugin to offer similar functionality, breaks custom theme design across the board. It does accomplish the job of making blocks easier to select, but the sacrifice of a WYSIWYG is not worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/editor-block-outline/\">Editor Block Outline</a> plugin has been my <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/navigate-the-content-canvas-with-the-block-editor-outline-wordpress-plugin\">go-to recommendation</a> for a while. It has a few design issues of its own, but some of those are adjustable on a per-user basis. However, as of late, it has made the editor feel sluggish. Plus, its misuse of the WordPress admin notice system for Twitter followers makes it something I&rsquo;d prefer to steer clear of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-options/\">EditorsKit</a> has a similar &ldquo;block guidelines&rdquo; feature that uses a box-shadow instead of padding and an outline. It does not muck up most theme layouts with that technique. However, I have hit other style conflicts with the plugin. Plus, EditorsKit is overkill for users who simply want just one feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leaves us with Wayfinder. Warts and all, it is the best standalone option right now. Maybe that&rsquo;s not saying much, but it is saying something. This is a feature that is hard to nail down.  I do not envy the developers who are trying to make miracles happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is sure to please many who have been on the lookout for a block outline solution. It is in a position to pull farther ahead of the competition with its relatively solid first outing. With more thorough theme testing and a bit of adjustment to its approach, it could be even better. I am eager to test future iterations.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 01:56:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WordPress.org blog: People of WordPress: Tijana Andrejic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10427\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/06/people-of-wordpress-tijana-andrejic/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13617:\"<p><strong>WordPress is open source software, maintained by a global network of contributors. There are many examples of how WordPress has changed people’s lives for the better. In this monthly series, we share some of the amazing stories.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This month to coincide with WordCamp Europe, we feature Tijana Andrejic from Belgrade, Serbia, about her journey from fitness trainer to the WordPress world, with the freelance and corporate opportunities it introduced. </p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"632\" height=\"387\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/06/2021-07-Tijana-Andrejic_Featured-Img_1.jpg?resize=632%2C387&ssl=1\" alt=\"Tijana - portrait picture\" class=\"wp-image-10713\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As a professional manager with a college degree in Organizational Science and a certified fitness instructor, Tijana is nothing if not driven and goal-oriented.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following her time as a fitness trainer, Tijana moved to work in IT around 2016. She first explored content creation and design before focusing on SEO and becoming an independent specialist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana was hired as a Customer Happiness Engineer for a hosting company, where she discovered the benefits of having a team. She realized that having close working relationships with colleagues is helpful for business success and accelerates personal growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana hopes that by sharing her story, she can help others who are either starting their career or are moving roles. She describes the opportunities she discovered in the WordPress community as ‘a huge epiphany’, especially in the world of freelancing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She highlights <strong>5 things that helped her to start a new freelancing career</strong>. Let’s dive into them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What motivates me?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“Why am I doing this?” is the first question that Tijana asks herself before starting anything new. This self-review and honesty, she feels, allows her to determine her priorities. She also benchmarks options around her motivations of wanting a flexible schedule and to grow professionally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She lists the reasons to make a particular choice, like being a freelancer, to help her choose the right job, pathway, or identify alternatives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She recommends that others can take a similar approach. If freelancing is still the best solution after examining all their goals and motivations, Tijana believes a good next step would be to learn WordPress-related skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cdHeIL-H_mE6QFCUxUT-gfKS2GzizRHtn4iCENoaWOimC82BfModRJh44QbhvHPW0GNVP5eUPhgxQteDRbA_9EUzpssTXMGWje1hUuKyrfXUgGhCnvXQdraaUQiaGBjFr73dNYxr\" alt=\"WordCamp Europe 2019 group picture\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Develop WordPress related skills</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question you may ask: “Why WordPress?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is used by more than 40% of websites in some form and offers various roles, many of which are not developer-specific. Tijana highlights a few:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>web developer (coding websites, themes, and plugins)</li><li>web implementor (creating websites from existing themes without coding)</li><li>web designer (designing website mock-ups, editing images, or creating online infographics)</li><li>client support professional (helping people with their websites)</li><li>website maintenance (WordPress, themes, and plugins are maintained and backed up regularly)</li><li>WordPress trainer (helping clients with how to use the platform or teaching other web professionals)</li><li>content writer</li><li>accessibility specialist (making sure standards are met and suggesting solutions for accessibility barriers)</li><li>SEO consultant (improving search outcomes and understanding)</li><li>statistics consultant, especially for web shops</li><li>WordPress assistant (adding new content and editing existing posts)</li><li>website migration specialist (moving websites from one server to another)</li><li>web security specialist</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/16XExYT_P4R4PX3orOaWbueDfkBIA6PFQ-CuYEXdeN9AvUIuIF33aIjT1DpdnFCqhrijWv1f68OR2Qh14xGT9REHGJ-MqK-OxJ9XcrhZ3IkcW8DBI7nVAtvFcCnCHL0woka_FV6t\" alt=\"WCBGD group picture\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana emphasized: “Another reason why WordPress is great for freelancers is the strong community that exists around this content management system (CMS).&#8221; WordCamps and Meetups are a way to get useful information and meet people from a large and very diverse community and get answers to many questions straight away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past year, these events have been primarily online. However, the contributors who run them continue to make an effort to provide an experience as close to in-person events as possible. The biggest advantage to online events is that we can attend events from across the world, even if sometimes during these difficult times, it is difficult to get enough time to deeply into this new experience. Since Tijana’s first Meetup, she has attended many WordPress community events and volunteered as a speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plan in advance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Becoming a freelancer takes time. For Tijana, success came with proper planning and following her plan to ‘acquire or improve relevant skills that will make you stand out in the freelance market.’ She strongly believes that learning and growing as a professional opens more business opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering a freelance career, she advises improving relevant skills or developing new skills related to your hobbies as ‘there is nothing better than doing what you love.’ In cases where no previous experience and knowledge can be used, she suggests choosing ‘a job that has a shorter learning curve and builds your knowledge around that.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana started as a content creator and learned to become an SEO expert. However, she highlights many alternative paths, including starting as a web implementer and moving to train as a developer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She suggests to others: “It would be a good idea to analyze the market before you jump into the learning process.” She also recommends people check the latest trends and consider the future of the skills they are developing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit the new <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress.org</a> to see what topics are of interest to you. In this newly established resource, the WordPress community aggregates workshops to support those who want to start and improve their skills, provides lesson plans for professional WordPress trainers and helps you create personal learning to develop key skills. There is also material on helping you be part of and organize events for your local community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana highlights that there are many places for freelancers to find clients. For example, the WordPress Community has a place where companies and individual site owners publish their job advertisements&nbsp; &#8211; <a href=\"https://jobs.wordpress.net/\">Jobs.WordPress.net</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hurray, it’s time to get a first freelancing job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a pragmatic person, Tijana recommends: “Save money before quitting your job to become a full-time freelancer. Alternatively, try freelancing for a few hours per week to see if you like it. Although some people do benefit when taking a risk, think twice before you take any irreversible actions.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She shared some possible next steps:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>use a freelancing platform</li><li>triple-check your resume</li><li>professionally present yourself</li><li>fill up your portfolio with examples</li><li>use video material</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“By using video material, your clients will not see you like a list of skills and previous experiences, but as a real person that has these skills and experiences and that provides a certain service for them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She adds: “Have a detailed strategy when choosing your first employer. Choose your first employer wisely, very wisely. I can’t emphasize enough how important this is”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Tijana took her first freelancing job, she considered the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>how was the employer rated by other freelancers who worked for him previously</li><li>how does the employer rate other freelancers</li><li>how much money had they already spent on the platform</li><li>the number of open positions for a specific job and the number of freelancers that have already applied&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“The first job is not all about the money. Don’t get greedy on your first job. If you get good recommendations, your second job can pay two to three times more. And your third job can go up to five times more. That was my experience.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Take responsibility as a freelancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana reminds us: “Freedom often comes with responsibility; individual responsibility is key when it comes to freelancing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She advises others not to take a job if you can not make a deadline and have someone reliable who can help you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Missing deadlines will cost your client money and affect the review the client will be willing to leave about your job, and this can have a big impact on your future opportunities or freelance jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She adds: “This can start a downward spiral for your career. However, we are all humans, and unpredictable things can happen. If for some reason you are not able to complete your work in a timely manner, let your client know immediately so they can have enough time to hire someone else”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana emphasizes the importance of making expectations clear before accepting a job, both what the client is expecting and what you can expect from the client.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, she points out that if you are working from home, your friends and family should treat you the way they would if you were in an office. She advises: “Let them know about your working schedule.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She hopes that these basic guidelines will be useful in launching freelance careers, as they did her, even though there is no universal recipe for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana highlights: “It’s just important to stay focused on your goals and to be open to new opportunities.” Freelancing wasn’t the only way she could have fulfilled her goals, but it was an important part of her path, and it helped her be confident in her abilities to make the next big step in her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, she was missing close relationships with colleagues and teamwork, which she has now found in her current firm. Her colleagues describe her as a: “walking-talking bundle of superpowers: sports medicine and fitness professional, SEO expert, blogger, designer and a kitty foster mum”.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PIGT9R6FmtEHsNBvWzyViW5htRAm156asTOsohOGOUwfsWjW1TuDhUI9yuZnjIe-1eFHfFUWPULPtw82P3YYXHa0bsY_jA5keelmDHfSkTdd3xUsVZTmG9KvdE8XTojvU3LxYCsi\" alt=\"Conference reception\" />\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering starting your career as a freelancer, take the courses offered at <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">learn.wordpress.org,</a> reach out to companies that you would be interested in working with, and remember that there are a whole host of opportunities in the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">The WordPress.org Teams</a> &#8211; what they do, when and where they meet</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress resource</a> &#8211; free to use to expand your knowledge and skills of using the platform and learning about the community around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3-day <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp Europe 2021</a> online event begins on 7 June 2021.

Australian co-founders Russell Ivanovic and Philip Simpson are staying on to continue leading Pocket Casts as a part of the acquisition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app allows users to keep all of their podcast subscriptions together in one place and sync between platforms. Previously a commercial-only app, Pocket Casts has been free since it switched to the freemium model in September 2019. Its creators have been monetizing the app through its Pocket Cast Plus tier, which gives users access to desktop apps, cloud storage, watch playback, and themes and icons for $9.99/year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2018, Pocket Casts was acquired by public media organizations NPR, WNYC Studios, WBEZ Chicago, and This American Life. BBC Studios also held a small ownership stake in the platform prior to Automattic&rsquo;s acquisition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being widely regarded as one of the best podcasting apps available, NPR&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://media.npr.org/documents/about/statements/fy2020/National%20Public%20Radio%20-%20Consolidated%20Financial%20Statements%202020.pdf\">financial statements and auditor&rsquo;s report from 2020</a> shows a net loss of more than $800K. The board governing the company met in December 2020 and agreed to sell Pocket Casts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No financial details of the acquisition were disclosed but Automattic may have gotten a bargain on Pocket Casts if its other owners were also losing money. After acquiring <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-tumblr-plans-to-rebuild-the-backend-powered-by-wordpress\">Tumblr</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-day-one-journaling-app\">Day One</a>, Automattic is starting to gain a reputation for buying up apps that people love to use and giving them a fighting chance at financial stability and longevity. The company has also demonstrated a growing interest in podcasting-related technologies with its  recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/castos-picks-up-756k-in-funding-from-automattic-and-joost-de-valk-to-expand-services-in-the-private-podcasting-market\">investment in Castos</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2021/02/22/turn-your-wordpress-com-blog-into-a-podcast-with-anchor/\">partnership with Spotify&rsquo;s Anchor</a> podcast creation platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acquisition announcements often include assurances of no changes for current customers but Automattic&rsquo;s post made no promises and did not share many details regarding its plans for Pocket Casts. Integration with WordPress.com may be on the horizon but it&rsquo;s currently in the exploration stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As part of Automattic, Pocket Casts will continue to provide you with the features needed to enjoy your favorite podcasts (or find something new),&rdquo; Automattic&rsquo;s Head of Apps Eli Budelli said.&nbsp;&ldquo;We will explore building deep integrations with WordPress.com and Pocket Casts, making it easier to distribute and listen to podcasts. We&rsquo;re thrilled that we can continue to give our users a multitude of ways to tell and engage with stories that matter.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 22:39:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"WPTavern: Google Concludes FLoC Origin Trial, Does Not Intend to Share Feedback from Participants\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119872\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:237:\"https://wptavern.com/google-concludes-floc-origin-trial-does-not-intend-to-share-feedback-from-participants?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=google-concludes-floc-origin-trial-does-not-intend-to-share-feedback-from-participants\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6127:\"<p>Google quietly concluded its <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/floc\">FLoC</a> (Federated Learning of Cohorts) origin trial this week. The trial was part of Google&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://privacysandbox.com/\">Privacy Sandbox</a> initiative, a suite of new technologies designed to replace third-party cookies, fingerprinting, and other commonly-used tracking mechanisms. This particular experiment groups people together based on browsing habits and labels them using machine learning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>FLoC&rsquo;s trial was scheduled to end Jul 13, 2021, and Google has decided to remove the project from the testing phase while analyzing feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve decided not to extend this initial Origin Trial,&rdquo; Google senior software engineer Josh Karlin said in <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/MmijXrmwrJs/m/f0Nc6h-KAQAJ\">thread</a> on Chromium&rsquo;s Blink Developers group forum. &ldquo;Instead, we&rsquo;re hard at work on improving FLoC to incorporate the feedback we&rsquo;ve heard from the community before advancing to further ecosystem testing.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The controversial experiment has been met with opposition from privacy advocates like makers of the <a href=\"https://brave.com/why-brave-disables-floc/\">Brave</a> browser and <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea\">EFF</a> who do not perceive FLoC to be a compelling alternative to the surveillance business model currently used by the advertising industry. Amazon, GitHub, Firefox, Vivaldi, Drupal, Joomla, DuckDuckGo, and other major tech companies and open source projects have already opted to block FLoC by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, Twitter has been the first major online platform that <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/07/05/twitter-appears-to-be-on-board-with-googles-floc-initiative/\">appears to be on board with FLoC</a> after references to it were recently discovered in the app&rsquo;s source code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google&rsquo;s initial efforts in presenting FLoC failed to gain broad support, which may have contributed to the company putting the brakes on its plan to phase out third-party cookies in Chrome by 2022. As the advertising industry yields to pressure from the last few years of privacy legislation, third-party cookies will be on their way out in what is colloquially known as the &ldquo;Cookie Apocalypse.&rdquo; Google has <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/updated-timeline-privacy-sandbox-milestones/\">postponed</a> this milestone for Chrome to begin in mid-2023 and end in late 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We need to move at a responsible pace,&rdquo; Chrome Privacy Engineering Director Vinay Goel said. &ldquo;This will allow sufficient time for public discussion on the right solutions, continued engagement with regulators, and for publishers and the advertising industry to migrate their services. This is important to avoid jeopardizing the business models of many web publishers which support freely available content.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussion on a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/53069\">proposal for WordPress to block FLoC</a> has stalled in Trac but may have been premature in the first place if FLoC doesn&rsquo;t end making it to further testing. Proponents of blocking FLoC saw WordPress&rsquo; support or opposition as critical to the success or failure of FLoC adoption on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A recent article on the WordPress.com VIP blog titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://wpvip.com/2021/06/23/goodbye-third-party-cookies-hello-googles-floc/\">Goodbye, Third-Party Cookies, Hello Google&rsquo;s FloC,</a>&rdquo; indicates that Automattic may be straddling the fence on the controversial new technology:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>FLoC has its plus points. But it isn&rsquo;t as privacy-focused as we would like, and can lead to discriminatory practices, as described above. Then there&rsquo;s the concern of letting Google dominate yet another aspect of tech. Google also plans to charge any third-party tracking company for use of any of the data it has collected.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For the time being, it looks like major tech platforms are off the hook for taking an active position on FLoC since it has been sent back for major modifications. In the most recently <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/updated-timeline-privacy-sandbox-milestones/\">updated timeline</a> for Privacy Sandbox milestones, Vinay Goel said Google received &ldquo;substantial feedback from the web community during the origin trial for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sustainability-and-the-importance-of-and/\">first version</a>&nbsp;of FLoC.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the conclusion of its origin trial, FLoC seems far from ready for adoption, having failed to gain a foothold in the industry. The concern is that Google may ram FLoC through anyway using the weight of Chrome&rsquo;s market share, despite the web community&rsquo;s chilly reception. Although these proposed changes to ad tech will impact the entire industry, as well as regular internet users, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/08/google_floc_changes/\">Google does not intend to disclose any of the private feedback</a> the company received during FLoC&rsquo;s origin trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The main summary of that feedback will be the next version, and you can surmise based on what features (and the reasoning for these changes) are available in the next version,&rdquo; Google mathematician Michael Kleber said during a recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1413096551359123457\">Web Commerce Interest Group (WCIG) meeting</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Privacy advocates want to see more transparency incorporated into this process so that major concerns are not left unaddressed, instead of leaving it to stakeholders across the web to try to deduce what Google has solved in the next version of FLoC. Overhauling the advertising industry with new technologies should be done in the open if these changes are truly intended to protect people&rsquo;s privacy.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 03:26:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: Edupack Is Tackling Higher Ed With WordPress, Looking for Development Partners\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119928\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:219:\"https://wptavern.com/edupack-is-tackling-higher-ed-with-wordpress-looking-for-development-partners?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=edupack-is-tackling-higher-ed-with-wordpress-looking-for-development-partners\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6721:\"<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re basically building the Jetpack for Higher Ed,&rdquo; said Blake Bertuccelli as he pitched me on the idea of <a href=\"https://edupack.dev/\">Edupack</a>, a project still in its early stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He and his team are looking for more advisors to <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/braintrust-008-wordpress-blocks-for-higher-ed-pros-tickets-163114043495\">join the eighth round</a> of their once-monthly braintrust events. It is a project they began in November 2020, now coming to fruition. Feedback is crucial to pushing such undertakings out of the gate, and the team needs more of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bertuccelli listed several focal points for the Edupack project:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Onboarding:</strong> New campus users can set up a beautiful campus WordPress site with a few clicks.</li><li><strong>Archiving:</strong> Stale sites are automatically archived to save campus resources.</li><li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Accessibility, plagiarism, and resource usage can be accessed from the Edupack dashboard.</li><li><strong>Brand and Content Management:</strong> Approved Higher Ed content patterns and universal brand controls keep sites beautiful and consistent.</li><li><strong>Configuration Management:</strong> Cloud-controlled configuration settings means admins can control millions of sites from one place.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img />Onboarding form with Tulane-branded elements.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our onboarding form offers pre-built sites for users to start from,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli. &ldquo;So, if a scientist needs a new site for their lab, the scientist can select a pre-built lab site from our onboarding form then add in their unique content.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bertuccelli is Edupack&rsquo;s CEO. He called himself a &ldquo;forever learner&rdquo; and is currently reading <em>A History of Western Philosophy</em> by Bertrand Russell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I paid for my Tulane education by coding WordPress themes,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli. &ldquo;After college, I founded one of New Orleans&rsquo; first WordPress dev shops (<a href=\"https://decubing.com/\">Decubing</a>). A year ago, I presented on building a self-publishing platform with Multisite at WP Campus. The feedback was phenomenal, and two blokes from Birmingham offered to work on a plugin with me. A few months later, we launched Edupack&rsquo;s MVP. Since then, folks from Harvard, Dartmouth, and about 17 other universities have been working with us to make WordPress an even better CMS for Higher Ed pros.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &ldquo;two blokes&rdquo; he is referring to are his co-founders, Nathan Monk and Matt Lees. They run a WordPress shop called <a href=\"http://wearesmile.com/\">SMILE</a>. Monk is serving as Edupack&rsquo;s CTO. Lees is the Chief Creative Officer &mdash; Bertuccelli called him &ldquo;Lord of the UX.&rdquo; Altogether, the three co-founders have over 30 years of experience working with Higher Ed and WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Edupack team is making accessible content a priority, which is a primary issue for Higher Ed. The goal is to offer A11Y reports inside of the WordPress dashboard and tie them into publishing workflows. This would notify users of errors as they publish content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our accessibility reports tie into another feature we are launching this month: site archiving,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli. &ldquo;Campus users graduate and often forget about their sites. Edupack sends a notification to a user if the site hasn&rsquo;t been accessed, then adds an &ldquo;archived&rdquo; meta value to the site that super administrators can take action from.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Setting up automated archiving.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Devs often recode thousands of sites to add new Campus branding,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli on the reasons behind Edupack. &ldquo;Department budgets are drained on resources for stale sites. Institutions are sued over inaccessible content or misused branding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Edupack intends to automate website management so that Higher Ed pros can focus on supporting education.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following video is an introduction to Edupack:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Join the Braintrust Session</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Every third Wednesday of each month, Edupack holds a &ldquo;Braintrust&rdquo; event. Bertuccelli says it is the best way to get involved. The session lasts for an hour over a Zoom video chat. The <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/braintrust-008-wordpress-blocks-for-higher-ed-pros-tickets-163114043495\">next event is scheduled</a> for July 21, 10 am &ndash; 11 am (CDT).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each session focuses on a single question. Next week&rsquo;s question: &ldquo;How can we enhance WordPress blocks for Higher Ed?&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll demo Edupack updates, brainstorm solutions for block enhancements, then wrap up with action steps for us to do by next month,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli. &ldquo;Folks who manage WordPress sites for global institutions and companies have attended our last seven braintrusts. Any Higher Ed pro is welcome!&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those interested can also keep track of progress via the <a href=\"https://joinedupack.wordpress.com/\">Edupack blog</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing and the Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">There is currently no publicly available pricing list. The project&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://edupack.dev/frequently-asked-questions/\">FAQs page</a> says the team is still tuning the costs, and Bertuccelli remained quiet on any hard numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Community colleges can&rsquo;t afford tech used by bigger schools,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair. Edupack will be priced so that every institution can afford the service. We haven&rsquo;t thought about pricing beyond that.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universities that wish to get check out the project should schedule a demo from the site&rsquo;s homepage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edupack has around 20 institutions serving as development partners and guiding <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/joinedupack/projects/2\">the roadmap</a>.

With so many enhancements headed our way, even we have not been able to keep up with them all here at WP Tavern. The next release will bring a few much-needed media-related upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users should enjoy WebP image format support and a copy-to-clipboard button on the media upload screen. Developers have a new hook for filtering the image output format, and the platform is dropping infinite scrolling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 is scheduled to ship on July 20, so these changes will be landing in less than a week. If you have not already done so, give <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/wordpress-5-8-release-candidate-3/\">WordPress 5.8 Release Candidate 3</a> a test run and report any issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Infinite Scroll Replaced With Ajax Button</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>Media Library screen (first) and overlay (second) with &ldquo;load more&rdquo; buttons. \n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The upcoming core release will <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/50105\">drop infinite scrolling</a> for media in favor of an Ajax-powered &ldquo;Load more&rdquo; button. The admin screen and editor&rsquo;s media overlay will cap the initial and subsequent &ldquo;pages&rdquo; to 40 media items each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This change is a part of an effort from the WordPress accessibility team to improve the experience for end-users. Team member and core contributor Andrea Fercia noted <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40330\">two a11y problems with infinite scrolling</a>. The first is that it is impossible or nearly for keyboard users to reach content appended to the screen. Second, there is no audible feedback or instructions about how infinite scrolling works for screen readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also noted usability and performance issues. Infinite scroll can break the browser&rsquo;s history, and there is no JavaScript fallback. And loading hundreds or more large-sized images increases the memory footprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the media library is getting the Ajax treatment in WordPress 5.8, we should expect similar updates for other areas in the future, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Add Themes Screen</li><li>Customizer &gt; Add Menu Items</li><li>Editor &gt; Link &gt; Search</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Copy URL From Add New Media Screen</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Copy URL to clipboard button on the Add New Media screen.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">This change is an enhancement that rids the platform of a small but noticeable nuisance that has plagued it for years. When uploading an image from the Media &gt; Add New screen in the WordPress admin, there was no way to grab its URL without clicking over to the edit screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 introduces a &ldquo;Copy URL to clipboard&rdquo; button that appears after the image has been uploaded. No need to leave the page and track down the URL. The change also makes the user experience consistent with the Media Library screen and overlay in the post editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More often than not, browsing Trac means seeing many of the same names. This time around, it seems that a regular user wanted a feature. They created an account &mdash; perhaps for this purpose alone &ndash;, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/add-a-copy-link-button-at-the-media-upload-page/\">wrote a support forum post</a>, was directed to Trac, and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51754\">created their first ticket</a>. It took eight months to work its way into WordPress, but it is one of those success stories of an average user making things happen by just providing feedback. Thanks for the contribution, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/anotia/\">@anotia</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WebP Image Format Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">WordPress is allowing a new image format. And, no, it is <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24251\">not SVG</a> (technically not an image). There are still security hurdles to jump for that to ever happen. However, it now supports WebP, which carries with it the promise of better performance for those who use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Sarah Gooding <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-introduces-support-for-webp-images\">reported for WP Tavern</a> last month:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This modern image file format was created by Google in September 2010, and is now supported by 95% of the web browsers in use worldwide. It has distinct advantages over more commonly used formats, providing both lossless and lossy compression that is 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs and 25-34% smaller than comparable JPEG images.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the report, she noted that only 1.6% (<a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/im-webp\">currently at 1.8%</a>) of the top 10 million websites used the WebP format. With WordPress now adding support, that percentage is likely to rise in the coming years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Developers: Image Editor Output Format Hook</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For developers who want to transform images with one mime type to another, 5.8 introduces the <code>image_editor_output_format</code> <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/52867\">filter hook</a>. Plugin authors can convert all newly uploaded images or only overwrite specific formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following example converts JPG images to the new WebP format:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>add_filter( \'image_editor_output_format\', function( $formats ) {\n        $formats[\'image/jpeg\'] = \'image/webp\';\n\n        return $formats;\n} );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The output format will be applied to all image sub-sizes as they are created. However, this will only work for WebP images if the webserver supports it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 03:09:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce Patches Critical Vulnerability, Sending Forced Security Update from WordPress.org\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=120008\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:249:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-patches-critical-vulnerability-sending-forced-security-update-from-wordpress-org?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=woocommerce-patches-critical-vulnerability-sending-forced-security-update-from-wordpress-org\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3619:\"<p>WooCommerce has <a href=\"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2564657/\">patched</a> an unspecified, critical vulnerability identified on July 13, 2021, by a security researcher through Automattic&rsquo;s HackerOne security program. The vulnerability impacts versions 3.3 to 5.5 of the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://woocommerce.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2c1434dc56f9506bf3c3ecd21&id=8ff0a5345f&e=0110b26bc5\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce</a> plugin, as well as version 2.5 to 5.5 of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/\">WooCommerce Blocks</a> feature plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Upon learning about the issue, our team immediately conducted a thorough investigation, audited all related codebases, and created a patch fix for every impacted version (90+ releases) which was deployed automatically to vulnerable stores,&rdquo; WooCommerce Head of Engineering Beau Lebens said in the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/critical-vulnerability-detected-july-2021/\">security announcement</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.org is currently pushing out forced automatic updates to vulnerable stores, a practice that is rarely employed to mitigate potentially severe security issues impacting a large number of sites. Even with the automatic update, WooCommerce merchants are encouraged to check that their stores are running the latest version (5.5.1).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since WooCommerce backported this security fix to every release branch back to 3.3, store owners using older versions of WooCommerce can safely update to the highest number in their current release branch even if not running the very latest 5.5.1 version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of publishing, only 7.2% of WooCommerce installations are using version 5.5+. More than half of stores (51.7%) are running on a version older than 5.1. WordPress.org doesn&rsquo;t offer a more specific breakdown of the older versions, but it&rsquo;s safe to say without these backported security fixes, the majority of WooCommerce installs might be left vulnerable.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The security announcement indicates that WooCommerce cannot yet confirm that this vulnerability has not been exploited:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Our investigation into this vulnerability and whether data has been compromised is ongoing. We will be sharing more information with site owners on how to investigate this security vulnerability on their site, which we will publish on our blog when it is ready. If a store was affected, the exposed information will be specific to what that site is storing but could include order, customer, and administrative information.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are concerned about possible exploitation, the WooCommerce team is <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/critical-vulnerability-detected-july-2021/#comment-19937832\">recommending merchants update their passwords</a> after installing the patched version as a cautionary measure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news for WooCommerce store owners is that this particular critical vulnerability was responsibly disclosed and patched within one day after it was identified. The plugin&rsquo;s team has committed to being transparent about the security issue. In addition to publishing an announcement on the plugin&rsquo;s blog, WooCommerce also emailed everyone who has opted into their mailing list.

He&rsquo;s been working with open source software for almost twenty years, and has been the president of Joomla, a member of Make WordPress Hosting and contributor to ICANN At-Large. He is well known for his public speaking about open source and so the discussion today is broad and thought provoking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about Robert&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gutenberg First&rsquo; approach in which he places the WordPress Block Editor at the heart of all that he does. He sees Gutenberg as a critical component for WordPress&rsquo; future; a future in which as yet unimagined technologies will be built on top of Gutenberg and leverage the &lsquo;atomic&rsquo; way data is stored.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads to a discussion on how 3rd party developers will be able to use Gutenberg as an application platform, with unique pathways to create, store and display content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The heritage of Gutenberg&rsquo;s development is also discussed. Right from the start we knew that the intention of the project was ambitious; it&rsquo;s aim to become a full site editor was explained at the outset.

Robert is director of WordPress at Cloudways. He&rsquo;s been working with open source software for almost 20 years and has been president of Joomla, a member of Make WordPress Hosting and contributor to ICANN At-Large. He&rsquo;s well known for his public speaking about open source, and so the discussion today is broad and thought provoking. We talk about Robert&rsquo;s Gutenberg first approach in which he places the WordPress block editor at the heart of all that he does. He sees Gutenberg as a critical component for WordPress&rsquo; future, a future in which as yet unimagined technologies will be built on top of Gutenberg and leverage the atomic way that data is stored.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>This leads to a discussion of how third party developers will be able to use Gutenberg as an application platform with unique pathways to create, store and display content. The heritage of Gutenberg&rsquo;s development is also discussed. Right from the start we knew that the intention of the project was ambitious. It&rsquo;s aim to become a full site editor was explained at the outset. This has led to comparisons with other editing tools and Robert takes on why he thinks that the incremental steps that the Gutenberg project has taken are making it a vital part of WordPress.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>We also look forward and get into the subject of how technology never stands still. The underpinnings of WordPress are shifting. New skills and tools will need to be learned, but that does not mean that existing ones are obsolete.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Shifting gears, we move into the community events and how we&rsquo;ve managed events during the last year. Robert is a huge proponent of in-person events and is hoping for their return. He loves the accidental situations which arrive when you&rsquo;re in the same space as so many other like-minded people. Perhaps though there&rsquo;s a place for hybrid event. Events in which there&rsquo;s in-person and online happening at the same time. Towards the end, we chat about the plethora of mergers and acquisitions, which are happening right now, as well as a discussion of Openverse, a search engine for openly licensed media, which launched with little fanfare recently.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>If any of the points raised in this podcast resonate with you, be sure to head over and find the post at WP Tavern dot com forward slash podcast, and leave a comment there.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>And so without further delay, I bring you Robert Jacobi.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I am joined by Robert Jacobi on the podcast today. How are you Robert?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:04:06]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Doing well. Fantastic to be here. Thank you Nathan.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:04:09]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Would you mind introducing yourself? Tell us who you are and what&rsquo;s your relationship with technology and work?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:04:15]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I&rsquo;m Robert Jacobi director of WordPress at Cloudways. I&rsquo;ve been in the open source space, wow, for almost 20 years, I&rsquo;m feeling old and actually got my raising on open source with the Joomla project, which is a hundred percent volunteer, open source content management system as well, and picked up WordPress slowly got into there. And boy, that&rsquo;s a lot of ands.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I love the community. I love the greater goal. That open source, espouses and tries to reach. And we&rsquo;re never, always successful. But having code and information more freely accessible is something I really believe in. And I think empowers people globally and provides opportunities that wouldn&rsquo;t happen if these ones and zeros were siloed away in golden towers. I&rsquo;m always just so tickled to talk about open source and all the interesting things we can do with it. It powers communities, it powers, politics, powers, freedoms, it powers companies. It&rsquo;s really amazing. And we talk about WordPress all the time as one of the defining tools in this space. You look at something like Linux, which pretty much literally everything uses these days. It&rsquo;s crazy how, to use Matt Mullenweg&rsquo;s, favorite phrase, these things democratize all of us in so many different ways.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:05:39]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>We&rsquo;ve got a really broad pallet of things that we&rsquo;re going to discuss today, ranging from Gutenberg, right through to WordCamps and all sorts. So we&rsquo;ll crack on with the smorgasbord of what we&rsquo;ve got to discuss. The first of our little laundry list is Gutenberg. You wanted to talk to us a bit today about Gutenberg, what you think of it, and so on. There was an event that I attended recently, which you were also in attendance at, and you were on a panel there, and you mentioned that in the face of proprietary page builders, you always had the approach that Gutenberg should be the first relation. It should come first. And I&rsquo;m curious to know, what did you mean by that? What is Gutenberg first? What is this approach?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:06:17]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So Gutenberg first to me is that we recognize the benefits of Gutenberg, and don&rsquo;t try to subvert them or sneak around them. I think Gutenberg is one of the most critical backend, frontend changes that has happened to WordPress in its last umpteen years and the potential for all the interesting future forward things that Gutenberg can do should be taken into account. So page builders are wonderful. They offer all this functionality, ease of use, but I think that, they should also take and utilize Gutenberg concurrently.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>The advantages are, one, that Gutenberg&rsquo;s not going anywhere. So God bless all the classic editor folk who loved that experience. More than just being deprecated, it&rsquo;s just, that is not going to be the way of the future.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>And secondly, the potential, what can happen when you start making all that content a bit more atomic. I come from a lot of database work. So you think of atomic data points and Gutenberg does that sort of automagically for you? So there are opportunities in the future with Gutenberg to start parcing that data more finely.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>That&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s very exciting and why everything should be Gutenberg first. Again, that doesn&rsquo;t mean get rid of page builders or different types of themes and theming systems. It&rsquo;s just that at the base, Gutenberg should be a core building block of what you&rsquo;re working with going forward.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:07:51]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>The way that I think many people are using Gutenberg at the moment, I should probably say the block editor, but if you&rsquo;re using the Gutenberg plugin, you&rsquo;ll obviously have an enhanced experience. But if you&rsquo;re using the block editor at the moment, it feels as if it&rsquo;s prime time for editing text, inserting images and some pretty basic stuff like that. But I can see on the horizon a whole plethora of interesting, curious, let&rsquo;s call them plug-ins for now, because that&rsquo;s what they are. Different block components, different plugins, which adapt and amend the capability of Gutenberg. And it feels to me as if that&rsquo;s where its strength might lie. I know we&rsquo;ve got the full site editing and all of that coming down the road, but it feels to me that, there&rsquo;s going to be a whole plethora of third-party tools, bringing all sorts of added benefits into the ecosystem, a block for this thing, and a block for that thing. And whilst that might create some kind of bloat, that to me is an exciting area, and I just wondered if that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re interested in, if there&rsquo;s any plugins or blocks that you&rsquo;ve been looking at and thinking, oh, that&rsquo;s curious. That seems to be stretching things a little bit.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:08:55]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So, you make a, first of all, great point that there&rsquo;s block editor and then Gutenberg platform as a whole, and what end users typically experience is the block editor, but the Gutenberg API, Gutenberg platform as a whole is going to allow for all sorts of crazy third party integrations. That&rsquo;s great. And it might even be a little, you said the perfect word, there might be a bit of bloat and craziness. I&rsquo;ll say that&rsquo;ll probably exist for the next 12 to 24 months. Sure, that&rsquo;s fine. As people figure out what works and doesn&rsquo;t. This is a dawn of a new age around taking WordPress to the next step. We&rsquo;ve talked about for many years, WordPress is just a blog, blah, blah, blah. Okay. We&rsquo;ve gotten past WordPress as a blog. Now WordPress as a CMS. That&rsquo;s great. I think what happens with Gutenberg is we look at it and say, WordPress is an application platform, and this is just another API that we can take advantage of in very different ways. So we can have forums that are much more catered to content creators, that get rid of all the WordPress backend and admin stuff. Okay, you&rsquo;re authenticated. You&rsquo;re logged in. Here&rsquo;s your daily news forum that you&rsquo;re going to add content to. And because we&rsquo;re using Gutenberg, that makes it a lot easier to publish that content and gets rid of the technical cruft, and allows developers and third-party plugin providers to have wholly unique and valuable experiences around that. And that&rsquo;s where the magic I think of Gutenberg really comes into play is where will all these third parties start finding those unique value propositions for specific content, whether it&rsquo;s an, a vertical, like travel or e-commerce, in a generic sense or news or publications or whatnot. It&rsquo;s really expanded the opportunities to create workflows and interfaces and make content production speedier and safer.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:10:55]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I think one of the curious things that I&rsquo;ve observed over the last couple of years about it is that perhaps if we had the magic rewind button, we could go back a couple of years and potentially not really get into a conversation where it was&hellip; okay, we&rsquo;ve got stage 1, 2, 3, and 4, and stages two, three, and four, start to add in functionality that things like page builders, can currently do, full site editing and all that. If it had just been touted as, we&rsquo;ve got a new editor for you, here it is, I think it would have taken people along for the ride much more easily, but we&rsquo;ve got this problem now, this impasse where, it got sold as it&rsquo;s going to become a page builder, but the pace of development and the fact that they&rsquo;ve got the legacy of 40 percent of the web, 40 plus percent of the web, to protect and so on it hasn&rsquo;t been able to move in that direction potentially at the speed that people thought&hellip; well, it&rsquo;s going to be a page builder. It hasn&rsquo;t been able to mature at the rate that they would have liked to have done. And so I&rsquo;m just curious in the next year, two years, whether it will do those things, but also I wish we could rewind and say look, slow down. Let&rsquo;s get the editor experience sussed out first, then we&rsquo;ll do the full site editing and don&rsquo;t expect it to be all these things. Beause at the minute I hear a lot of people saying it&rsquo;s not as good as the tool I&rsquo;ve got over here, and it&rsquo;s not as good as the tool I&rsquo;ve got over there. Speaking of which do you think there&rsquo;s a case where it isn&rsquo;t the best tool where you would say actually, do you know what, I&rsquo;m just going to relegate that and not use it first. Or is it literally, always the first thing in your toolkit for WordPress?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:12:28]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It is literally the first thing in my toolkit, because it will provide the greatest longevity in whatever&rsquo;s built. Gutenberg&rsquo;s not going anywhere. There was a massive commitment to it from the project side of the universe. And to answer one of your earlier questions about, has it done enough? I think it&rsquo;s exceeded all expectations and this is where I&rsquo;ll get to it. They&rsquo;re always going to be a voices like, okay, it doesn&rsquo;t make bacon and eggs for me in the morning. Okay, That&rsquo;s fine, it doesn&rsquo;t. I think, and I truly believe what the magic of Gutenberg is, is the paradigm shift in forcing people to look at other things. So it&rsquo;s hard to make a giant feature change in anything, whether it&rsquo;s proprietary project, open source project. There are going to be plenty of people who are like, no, this works for me. This is great. Please don&rsquo;t change. I get that. But technology moves forward. People&rsquo;s expectations increase. Ten years ago, we barely had iPhones. All of a sudden we do, and now we expect everything to be infinitely easier and simpler and more responsive. I guess it doesn&rsquo;t do everything that page builders do. That&rsquo;s great. That&rsquo;s fine. We&rsquo;re not trying to cut out the middle man here, and I say we, I&rsquo;m not actually involved directly in Gutenberg at any point, but it moves the technological user experience goal posts forward. All things being equal, the page builders of the world, Beaver Builder, Elementor, they&rsquo;re all going to go their own way. Having Gutenberg as a critical component, soon enough, it will be just a mandatory component, that&rsquo;s the end of the conversation. Says, listen, everyone, this is what we need as part of the ecosystem. This is how you&rsquo;re going to connect with tools. You can absolutely go around those, but why would you want to, because this will be supported by a worldwide community.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It&rsquo;s not just going to be supported by the Beaver Builder community or the Elementor community, yada yada, this is now the new core and that&rsquo;s very difficult to do, and it&rsquo;s not, jumping back to what I said earlier about it, I think just making that change in and of itself and committing to that change is more important than full site editor or anything else. There&rsquo;ll be incremental steps, but that was the big milestone step. Wow. Okay. This is the new tech, and we&rsquo;re going to have to take advantage of it.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:14:45]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>You said two words in that last little bit, well you certainly said paradigm shift and you said atomic. And I think for me, the atomic bit is really interesting because what I think many people haven&rsquo;t had a chance to get to grips with is literally the atomic nature of it. This little section of your blog post or whatever it may be. You can just have this little interactive thing. It might be that you&rsquo;ve got a block which does, I don&rsquo;t know, lead generation, or you&rsquo;ve got a block, like the cover block, which will just take care of the top of your posts. And each one of those things will have a different array of settings and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be built inside a proprietary thing. It&rsquo;s being built inside of the default editor for WordPress. So it&rsquo;s going to bring a ton of functionality and a ton of interesting things. Some of it will be bloated. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be many people who fall into the trap of installing fifty times more than they need to, or five times more than they need to. But for those of us who were curious and check things out and look and see what the end result is, you&rsquo;re going to be able to create really unique experiences on this one surface, and that to me is really exciting, but have the feeling that the community got left behind in the conversation about this a little bit. So the confusion that it was going to be a page builder leads me to the whole community conversation. I know you&rsquo;re all about community. This is something that you thrive on. You love the WordPress community, as you have had loved many other communities in the past. Do you have any feelings around whether there&rsquo;s been enough involvement. Asking the questions, what should it look like? How should it behave? What do we want to leave on the floor and edit out that we just, it was a blind alley, we shouldn&rsquo;t have had that because there are some things that I think a really excellent, there are some things that I think I&rsquo;m not sure anybody&rsquo;s actually going to make use of that, but there it is. And just wondering what your thoughts were around, whether the community had been involved, whether it could have been involved more.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:16:38]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I&rsquo;m getting chuckles about a lot of these things. Could there have been more all the editing and whatnot. Since community is, especially in WordPress, a huge word, it&rsquo;s always difficult to get every stakeholder, give them the space, give them the time given the vote.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>What I like about what happened with Gutenberg is that it did move, in my mind, relatively quickly, and expeditiously and said, this is what we&rsquo;re doing. And I think it&rsquo;s too easy to be bogged down in the politics of community to actually get stuff done. So if things fall to the wayside, if things were not edit out properly, that&rsquo;s where I think, the greater ecosystem can come into play and say, we&rsquo;re going to tweak this, with a plugin that makes this just a bit better. It takes this out and we have such a robust economy in WordPress. That yeah, go for it. I like to see a bit more activism from people as a whole on these projects, but it&rsquo;s hard. We all have day jobs. We all have stuff to do, and I&rsquo;m not going to blame the leaders of the project for trying to get stuff done. In fact, I&rsquo;m going to give them kudos to just doing it because it&rsquo;s very easy to get pulled back and say you didn&rsquo;t listen to so and so, at some point we have to fish or cut bait, we need to do something and we need to move the technology forward because everyone else is doing it. And open source projects have a tendency, especially at their, let&rsquo;s say late teens, early adult stages, getting sucked into managing the community more than managing the project and pushing it forward.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>You have to do both. It&rsquo;s such a tricky balance. All kudos to everyone at Make dot WordPress, that they were able to do this. And it&rsquo;s a large scale change and get it done. Fine, if you want to complain, that&rsquo;s great. Guess what? No software lives, at that moment in time, it&rsquo;s always updated and tweaked and there are still opportunities to make changes, advocate or different functionality. Expand the API, shrink the API, all those kinds of things. I do love that WordPress was able to cut bait and just go with it.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:18:43]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>One of the underpinnings of WordPress since the inception really was PHP. And obviously now we&rsquo;re moving into an era where these technologies are being inspected, and improvements have been created along the way. And so now we&rsquo;re moving into an era where other technologies, for example, React is coming along and that requires quite a bit of relearning, you&rsquo;ve really got to down tools, get the manuals out, start to read again. Do you have any concern that that kind of thing could be a bit of a roadblock? It will be a bit of have a roadblock for certain people, but the technology has to move forward. Just curious as to what your thoughts are about how that&rsquo;s being implemented and whether or not we&rsquo;re taking it at a slow enough pace or whether we should have just stuck with good old PHP?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:19:29]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I like to use the right tool for the right projects, And I&rsquo;ve been a coder, developer, engineer in multiple languages. I&rsquo;ve actually never done anything with React, that&rsquo;s one of the first ones. And that&rsquo;s okay. We evolve. If we hadn&rsquo;t evolved all these still using C from 1969 or whenever it came out. So this stuff has to move forward. And if React is the best solution to do that on the front end, that&rsquo;s great.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Some people will be excited by that. Okay. I can expand my personal knowledge and horizons by adding to React. Honestly, a lot of the headless stuff that we see these days is also React. So it&rsquo;s not a bad thing to learn if you want to learn that. If you don&rsquo;t want to learn it. Okay, that&rsquo;s fine. There are plenty of opportunities to still expand your WordPress activities solely with PHP. Okay. Those are more personal choices. Do I want to learn another language? Do I want to improve on what I already have? Yes. Those are choices you have to make, but none of this lives in isolation. So we have to understand that a WordPress, plain old PHP site, might still need to connect up to a bunch of different things and not all those things are going to be on PHP. You still might be connecting up to something with Perl or Python. No, one&rsquo;s forcing you to learn it. Granted Gutenberg injects this react universe into your face, but you can focus on the core things that you need to do without necessarily running into React. It&rsquo;s a tool that more people are&hellip; here&rsquo;s the trick, there are plenty of new people who are entering coding, development, open source communities, and they like React. So it makes sense to take advantage of all this new found wealth, and then also draw them back into the community. Great, you love running with all this JS stuff. Fantastic. Hey, by the way, did you know you could actually implement that as part and parcel with an old-school PHP content management system? Yeah, we can do that. That&rsquo;s great. And look how you can expand your horizon. Yeah, it stinks if you don&rsquo;t want to learn any kind of Node, React stuff. Okay. But, it&rsquo;s sort of the nature of code. If we really want to take the analogy to the extreme, why aren&rsquo;t we still coding on punch cards with ones and zeros. We&rsquo;re going to abstract it and find the best tool to implement the functionality we want to see.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>And I get it me personally, I&rsquo;m not going to go out and learn React today. Me twenty years ago, though, I would have added it into my tool belt in a heartbeat, just because it was just one of those things that you needed at that time, that was the case. People are going to go through their own personal and professional sort of life cycles of what they think they need to have on their knee or in their tool belt to be successful. We can&rsquo;t stop for people who don&rsquo;t want to do anything outside of PHP.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:22:04]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>We&rsquo;re going to shift gears now and talk about in-person events. Under the auspices of things like WordCamp Europe, which is depending on when you&rsquo;re listening to this podcast that may just have happened, or it may be it&rsquo;s coming around in a year&rsquo;s time or something like that.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Clearly we&rsquo;ve been through a period that has really shaken the community. I feel that as a community, we were probably as well-prepared as any community could be because we were already working via the internet. We all had our computers out and so on. And yet still there is a concern. And I know that for example, people like Josepha Haden Chomposy has mentioned things like this, that the community in the absence of in-person events, there&rsquo;s been a modest disengagement. And what I mean by that, this is the project, the WordPress project was propelled forward in a large part by those in-person events. So you&rsquo;ve got contrib day, you&rsquo;ve just got the handshaking, you can actually meet people for the first time. You can build relationships and so on. And none of that&rsquo;s happened. We&rsquo;ve had a year out. We don&rsquo;t know quite when that is coming back, hopefully at some point in the near future, but we don&rsquo;t know. And so just curious about your thoughts on that. What do you have to say about events coming back and how a project as big as WordPress, where there&rsquo;s no central office where there&rsquo;s no boss telling everybody what to do. So if you&rsquo;re on the payroll, you&rsquo;ve got to do this today and fix this thing, but that&rsquo;s not how it works. And so the open source model, there may be a chink in its armor here where in-person events don&rsquo;t happen, that camaraderie and those solutions don&rsquo;t present themselves. And so the project, I&rsquo;m going to use the word stalls, that&rsquo;s a complete over-exaggeration, but bits of the project stalled because nobody&rsquo;s meeting up.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:23:49]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I am a huge, huge advocate of in-person anything. Whether you&rsquo;re extrovert or introvert, there&rsquo;s always going to be someone that you really want to talk to sit down in a corner, or have a cup of coffee with and build that relationship. I&rsquo;m no anthropologist or anything, but feel that those kinds of human connections help us grow stronger in light of all the mundane things we do day to day. I don&rsquo;t think the project has suffered because of a lack of in-person events over the last year. I think it&rsquo;s suffered because everyone else has had a lot on their mind and there&rsquo;ll be a, certainly a renaissance of activity as soon as we get into in person but this is one of those things where I don&rsquo;t think correlation and causation match up. If you are worried about friends and family getting ill, did the economy, my personal economies take a downturn. That&rsquo;s going to weigh a lot more on someone than, oh, did I catch up on the latest WordPress dot org, Slack notification about Full Site Editing. So I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re completely tied together, but I will certainly tell you that as those in-person meetups start ramping up, I think that&rsquo;ll be a flurry of excitement and activity. Part of that will be just because we&rsquo;re not still trapped in our tiny little Covid bubbles.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:25:12]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>What personally do you miss from the in-person events? You mentioned about having a coffee and sitting in a corner with somebody and so on, but anything that you find you&rsquo;re missing, it could be something quite banal or it could be something a lot deeper.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:25:24]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It&rsquo;s really the accidents that happen at in person events. With a completely regimented online experience, I know I&rsquo;m going to be talking with Nathan at such and such time. I know I&rsquo;m going to be talking to whoever everything&rsquo;s organized, calendars. Okay, there&rsquo;s digital here, digital there. We may edit ourselves more on these platforms. When you&rsquo;re in-person accidents happen. We may be walking through the sponsor hall and accidentally bump shoulders. And it&rsquo;s oh my goodness, Nathan, great to see you. I haven&rsquo;t seen you in 14 months. This is amazing. And you just start a conversation and those kinds of conversations are organic and random and not necessarily so overly planned and well thought out. And at those moments, I think unique ideas, exciting things can happen that just don&rsquo;t happen in a much more shrunken space. I love the distributed world. And to your point, I think WordPress is not only just gone through well, it&rsquo;s actually succeeded because we&rsquo;ve already been in that position. We&rsquo;re already ready to be online and take care of the day to day.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>We need those accidental bumpings of atoms to create new kinds of alloys. Oh my goodness. carbon and oxygen linked together. Oh, no, look what happened here. I don&rsquo;t know what they do, I&rsquo;m not a chemist! But my point being is when you&rsquo;re in person and I&rsquo;m going to keep calling them accidents, but not like in a pejorative kind of way, accidents happen, and it allows for very random, unique ideas, conversations, thoughts, whatever to happen, or just even a personal pick me up. Like you do remember me from being on slack for the last year. That&rsquo;s fantastic. There&rsquo;s an affirmation I think that happens for all of us when we&rsquo;re in that kind of proximity with other like-minded people.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:27:21]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I think one of the, there&rsquo;s two points about the online events that I seem to keep coming back to. And the first one is that I feel it&rsquo;s taught us that we ought to have hybrid going forward. What I mean by that is that WordCamp EU, I feel it&rsquo;s going to be difficult to put the genie back in the box of you have to go to the place where the event is. I feel that the future is going to be, sure enough, if you want to turn up and you want to benefit from the hallway and all of those things, go for it. But also if you&rsquo;re living halfway around the world, that now needs to be a door which is not closed to you, you need to have it open. There needs to be streaming of those talks that are happening each day so that everybody can take part. That&rsquo;s one of the things that I feel is going to happen.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:28:03]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I completely agree. There are events that I would have never been able to attend on a very regular basis without there being an online component. Someone will solve this puzzle, but I think it&rsquo;s going to be difficult to do a online and in-person event concurrently. I feel that you&rsquo;ll get the worst of both worlds in that case. What I&rsquo;d like to see, let&rsquo;s take WordCamp Europe 2022. There&rsquo;s going to be a three, four day in person spectacle. That&rsquo;s fantastic. What I would like to see is maybe two days before the in-person starts. There&rsquo;s a whole online portion of that. I&rsquo;d be concerned about trying to do them concurrently. Are we really going to have, we can do all the live video for example, but how interactive can we make those live portions? Oh, look from online, we have a question to the speakers. Okay. That works. But outside of those sessions, how are we going to integrate the sponsor hall, the hallway track as we talk about it? Those are those accidents that I like to refer back to just walking up and down and bumping into each other. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an easy problem to solve, but I&rsquo;d love to see some kind of greater online kickoff onboarding experience, where you can meet the speakers, do some quick Q and A&rsquo;s, and conversely, have the speakers say, make sure you don&rsquo;t miss my session on such and such date and time, then that will, of course be also livestreamed.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It&rsquo;s going to be expensive. It&rsquo;s going to be complicated. And I think there&rsquo;s going to be multiple variations of attempts at making that succeed. I like to go with baby steps to see results. And I think just starting out with maybe a one or two day virtual camp tied to the in-person camp would be a good starter.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:29:46]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>That&rsquo;s what I was meaning really is just basically a camera at the back of the room where there&rsquo;s a presentation going on with the possibility of questions coming, not just from the audience, sat in the auditorium, but from people in a different part of the world. And in fact, I feel it in a way, these kind of like skeuomorphic pieces of software, which tries to replicate the real world, you&rsquo;ve got these AI representations of the hall. It&rsquo;s nice. It&rsquo;s a bit of fun. I feel it&rsquo;s a dead end. Nobody ought to be under the illusion that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re going to do. But I do like the idea of just, here&rsquo;s the talk, you can watch it at the same time as everybody else. And then maybe you and your pals can hang out. You can do your bit online and we can do our bit in the real world, and so it goes. It&rsquo;s really just an opening up so that you don&rsquo;t have to attend because the problem there would be that nobody actually makes the attempt to attend, but I don&rsquo;t feel that&rsquo;s the case. And my second point is that I feel that we need this stuff back just because the online stuff, there&rsquo;s a fatigue associated with that, and I don&rsquo;t for a minute think that everybody&rsquo;s fatigued and I don&rsquo;t for a minute, think the online events don&rsquo;t have merit because they have enormous merit and they&rsquo;ve been an amazing bridge, but I feel that there&rsquo;s a proportion of the people who would love to be at live events who just can&rsquo;t make the transition to the virtual events. There&rsquo;s something about it. Something stifles them, perhaps they have the best will in the world, and then it&rsquo;s on the screen. But then something in the real world occurs to them. The cat decides to chew up the sofas, so off you go, you&rsquo;ve got to deal with the cat. You get distracted, you want to go and make a cup of tea, so you get distracted. Whereas if you&rsquo;re at the WordCamp, you&rsquo;re fully there. You&rsquo;ve engaged, you&rsquo;ve committed. You&rsquo;ve potentially got on a plane. You&rsquo;ve booked a hotel, all of that. And there&rsquo;s no substitute for that. So that really was my second point is that I want to get the people who&rsquo;ve been disengaged back in and ready to take on all of the challenges that we&rsquo;ve got.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:31:42]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Yeah. I think we&rsquo;re on the same page. I can do virtual events. I certainly prefer in person. And the best example of how we know that in-person is very valuable is when you go to a lot of these virtual events, the networking spaces are generally very empty. People aren&rsquo;t having those conversations, those random accidental conversations that they would add an in-person event because at an in-person event, you are physically, quote unquote, stuck in that space. If you don&rsquo;t want to talk to someone, you&rsquo;re just going to go your own way. That&rsquo;s great. But if you do, who knows who&rsquo;s next to you and you&rsquo;re going to overhear things and interrupt the conversation and be interrupted and that&rsquo;s that magic that occurs.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:32:29]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Okay. Let&rsquo;s talk about the third point that we wanted to discuss today. I&rsquo;m straying into an area where I don&rsquo;t have a great deal of experience because I watch these things happen from afar. There&rsquo;s nothing that really concerned me. That concerned me in the sense that I might be a consumer of some of the things that are being bought up. But you wanted to talk about, as you described it, the WordPress economy acquisition madness. Now, what did you mean by that? Just kick us off. Explain what you mean by that phrase.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:32:56]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Here&rsquo;s the beauty of being a successful project, people with money will find ways to make money from it. And that&rsquo;s okay, and that&rsquo;s a good thing. We&rsquo;re seeing the likes of Automattic, WP Engine, GoDaddy, Liquid Web, Cloudways, yada, yada, yada. All these companies, wink wink, they&rsquo;re all hosting companies because they&rsquo;ve been in the space for awhile under different platforms and have recurring streams of revenue and cash on hand, they&rsquo;re going to look to grow their businesses, and one of the easiest ways is to find valuable niche projects, that not only will bring cool bit of code into what they&rsquo;re trying to do, but also allow them to reach out to all the people who have installed that plugin.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:33:45]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Do you have concern then that certain parts of the WordPress, let&rsquo;s say plugin or theme space, are going to be consumed by these bigger entities as you described? In many cases, there will be hosting companies for reasons you&rsquo;ve just explained. Do you have a feeling that silos in the future are going to occur? Where if you really want a decent, let&rsquo;s go for, I dunno, membership experience, you really are better off going in the direction of that company, with the brands that it&rsquo;s acquired over time. Or if you want to go for a WooCommerce experience, your best bet is going to be over here, and everything else is a poor relation of that. So we get silos, which we haven&rsquo;t had until now.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:34:28]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I think that&rsquo;ll happen in the short term, but when that happens, a vacuum is created in the overall ecosystem. So if hosting company X has a, quote unquote, monopoly on that membership plugin, you know what, first of all, it&rsquo;s all open source. All it takes is company Y to be like, we want to be in that space as well, and we&rsquo;re going to re-imagine the underlying open source code base in XYZ format. Yes, a lot of letters there, but it&rsquo;ll happen. These kinds of acquisitions and changes in economy I feel are okay. We&rsquo;re all working from an open source code base. If this was all proprietary stuff that you can never take advantage of, I think that would be bad for the community as a whole, but that&rsquo;s not the case. It&rsquo;s just one company saying we&rsquo;re going to be owners of this project. You can still fork that project any day of the week, don&rsquo;t forget. Cause it&rsquo;s all GPL. So I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re losing anything in the long run. There&rsquo;ll be short term hiccups. People won&rsquo;t be happy. If that plugin doesn&rsquo;t do exactly what they want, but they probably wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be happy even if it wasn&rsquo;t taken over by someone else. I think there&rsquo;s a percentage of people that will always want to see all this independent software, but all these companies are technically, okay maybe they&rsquo;re not all independent because some of them are actually listed on public exchanges, but the opportunity hasn&rsquo;t been taken away, and if such and such plugin gets acquired by such and such hosting company, I certainly see another hosting company looking for that competitor also happening.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:36:01]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Do you feel that, okay, again, rewinding the clock for the second time in this podcast, if we could go back maybe 6, 7, 8 years, something like that, before these companies were buying up suites of plugins and what have you, to bulk out their offering. We basically had independent plugin developers. There may have been a team that grew up over time and they were inventing a solution for a particular problem, and they were really invested in that, and that was great. We want to solve the calendar thing or we want to solve the, I don&rsquo;t know, the menu thing, whatever it may be. I&rsquo;m just wondering if we&rsquo;re maybe getting into the territory of designing things to be acquired. We designed something so that this can happen, so that we can become bought up, taken along for the ride by a big hosting company, and just really whether or not there&rsquo;s any dynamic that changes the way that instead of serving the customer and always trying to offer the best support for the product, really your whole intention for that business isn&rsquo;t to create the product for the customer, it&rsquo;s to create the product for the sell in the future.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:37:01]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I agree. I think there&rsquo;s a potential for that. On the correlator, are you getting value in what you want out of that product? So if I use, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m going to jump into because it&rsquo;s happened recently, but on the face of it, it&rsquo;s a product that is so useful to me that I&rsquo;m not going to have to do custom code. It&rsquo;s above and beyond every other plugin competitor in that space. Am I going to use it? I&rsquo;m going to use it, yes. And to some degree it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what the incentives for the developer are at that point. If it&rsquo;s doing what I wanted to do, that I&rsquo;m going to use it because that&rsquo;s what I needed to do, and it&rsquo;s going to save me 10 50, 200 hours of development time to use this plugin as opposed to trying to create something on my own. And that&rsquo;s question one, or the answer one. Answer two is there certainly is an issue with, what&rsquo;s a nice word for miscreant. I guess it&rsquo;s gonna be miscreant, where we&rsquo;ve seen recently some plugin developers literally switch out what that plugin does and what its value proposition is with, quote unquote, upgrades. And they&rsquo;ve done it behind your back. Oh, well you signed up for this cute little plugin that makes banners, guess what, now it&rsquo;s going to do all these things and you have to pay for it just to get banners again, and it&rsquo;s like really, really is that really what you want to do? And I think those developers are getting called out on it.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>The agencies and content creators, certainly in the nearby community are aware of that. I think those kinds of, yeah, they&rsquo;re not necessarily illegal in any way, shape or form because you can do that, but it doesn&rsquo;t really stick by the unofficial developer third party ecosystem code of conduct. And I think we&rsquo;re always going to see exceptions to the rule, but as long as those are just exceptions, I think we&rsquo;re in a good spot.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:38:43]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Let&rsquo;s pivot again. Openverse. I&rsquo;ve got to say, this is something that kind of passed me by. The radar wasn&rsquo;t working properly over the last few weeks since Openverse came along. I&rsquo;m going to ask you to tell us what Openverse is. I have a very vague understanding of what it is, but I&rsquo;d like you to tell us why you think it&rsquo;s important.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:39:03]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>This is a new project in the WordPress ecosystem. I should say WordPress dot org ecosystem. It comes from creative commons search project that was languishing at creative commons. They didn&rsquo;t have community and developers interested in pushing the search component along and, with support from Automattic, it came into the welcoming arms of wordpress dot org. And it has it&rsquo;s own thing called Openverse. I&rsquo;m excited by it. One, because it expands the open source vision of WordPress, WordPress becoming even a greater open source proponent. It&rsquo;s not just the CMS, but now we also have additional things that we&rsquo;re caring about, which I think is fantastic. It simultaneously is going to be working on technical aspects as well as open libra software model, or content model, I should say, where the tool will be helping WordPress as well as anyone else, obviously on finding creative commons, open licensed media. So in this case, images. I think it&rsquo;s a great expansion that&rsquo;s completely in line with what the project is looking to do. And I think it&rsquo;s going to be surprisingly helpful and people won&rsquo;t even realize what&rsquo;s going on, but they&rsquo;ll all of a sudden be able to access a bunch of new content natively in whatever application, obviously WordPress will be at that top of the list, but, you&rsquo;ll be able to access it with Drupal or proprietary systems.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:40:40]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>What was the problem with the old licensing model? What was broken with it?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:40:43]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>What was broken was there was no one who was going to commit to keeping up the code base to make CC search working and functioning, tweaking it, bug fixes, whatnot. So, as part of the WordPress project, there will actually be active development and maintenance of the creative common search.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:41:02]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Okay, so was there any concern that things which you may have downloaded from third-party sites, we all know the ones that we customarily go to, that they were often perhaps changing the license after you downloaded things, and then suddenly you didn&rsquo;t realize that you were in contravention of a license, which you thought you had full access to download, redistribute, do whatever you wanted and suddenly you realize, oh, okay, that&rsquo;s no longer the case. This image that I&rsquo;ve got, I need to take down.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:41:28]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So, licensing is so fun and entertaining. So a lot of these download an image sites, those licenses still stand. So if you have downloaded it and are using an image that was licensed under creative comments, that&rsquo;s not going away. Will they relicense new images? Possibly. The point is how easy will it be to find more creative commons based media? And I think that is the purpose of Openverse, to make that as easy and intuitive as possible. So again, it&rsquo;s taking what used to exist as part of creative, common search, almost like a fork, rebranding it under Openverse and, making it part of an ecosystem that&rsquo;s open source.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:42:15]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>And this is going to be completely available inside the WP admin. So you&rsquo;ll have search integrated there, and if you want to search for, I don&rsquo;t know, a cat on cushions, for example, you&rsquo;ll be able to do that and everything that&rsquo;s returned, you&rsquo;ll be able to use, hopefully because the search will have returned something valuable to you in this case cat&rsquo;s on cushions.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:42:35]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So that is my expectation.

I was then a 1st-year student of my 4-year Graduation Program. But the number of my earnings was not sufficient to cover all my livelihood. My parents were giving me support to continue my study at that time. So I was looking for more ways to earn my living. But in our country, it’s tough to get a job without graduation. I tried to find more tutoring jobs but failed to get one. Then I gave stand-up comedy a try. At that time, it became popular. I participated in a TV reality show based on stand-up comedy. But failed to reach the top five. So, didn’t get much success in the comedy sector as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/gtafdar_standup_comedy.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In this way, two years passed. After a while, I got the idea of a call center job in the telco industry of our country. I gave an interview to our number one telco company Grameenphone &#8211; a sister concern of Telenor. And luckily got the chance to join there. And it’s a game-changing part of my career. I learned a lot about team play, pressure handling, the ability to put myself in a customer’s shoes, and more. But it was a part-time job, and my graduation was about to end. Immediately after finishing my graduation, I got the opportunity to join Grameenphone’s Finance team. However, I had to pass the challenging interview as many other promising candidates were competing with me. Everything seemed so great at that time. Got the opportunity to work in the country&#8217;s best corporate office, but bad luck struck again. Didn’t get the chance to be a full-time employee from contractual employee status.</p>\n<p>I took a break to join the country&#8217;s public service commission. Unfortunately, I failed to get the desired position again. In the meantime, my father retired from his job. All of a sudden, so many responsibilities came upon me. By the way, I forgot to mention, in this time frame, I had completed my Graduation, Masters, and MBA. The year where I’m now in the beginning of 2018. After my father’s retirement, I had no time for an experiment. But the main challenge came then.</p>\n<blockquote><p>No one wanted to give me a chance as I worked at one of Bangladesh&#8217;s most prominent companies; they thought I couldn’t fit into their office culture.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Also, I wanted to start my career as a Digital Marketer, and I had no practical experience at that time. I had some certification of Udemy and Hubspot free courses. But I was confident that I had a degree of MBA in Marketing. But all of my confidence was doomed within three months. I stopped applying everywhere, started to do some research on the job sector. Finally, I decided to join the IT industry, and in our country, WordPress Based companies are in the leading position. So, I had my target fixed towards the WordPress industry.</p>\n<h3>A Huge Risk-Taking State in My Career:</h3>\n<p>I took a huge risk to start my career in the WordPress industry. After not seeing much job opportunities in the Digital Marketing area in my country, I was planning to join the telco industry again as I was finding no option to cherish my dream. I badly needed a job at that time. But meanwhile, I found a job circular in weDevs. They were looking for a Digital Marketer Intern. So I made my decision to take part in this program. Surprisingly, I got another job offer from a renowned MNC of our country in the sales team. But I took a huge risk and started trying for the weDevs internship program, and refused the salesperson job. My friends <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrMayeen\">Mayeen</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AkhterArif\">Arif</a> helped me a lot to learn more about WordPress. And they guided me on how I could set up localhost on my computer, and from then, I started to explore themes and plugins from the WordPress repository. I must say I got an interesting tool to play with. After passing three stages, I finally got the chance to join weDevs. weDevs is a popular WordPress Plugin making company. It’s famous for Dokan Multivendor Marketplace Solution for WooCommerce.</p>\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Gtarafdar_life_at_weDevs.jpg\"><img /></a>My Life at weDevs\n<p>Ohh, maybe you have a question about how it can be risky to go for the weDevs internship program! Well, the payout of the other company was three times higher than the weDevs internship payout. And I refused to join the other sales team while I still didn’t have any guarantee to join the weDevs team. So now you can judge, isn’t that risky? (Sorry, I can’t share the name of the sales company publicly here due to some policy issue.)</p>\n<h3>The Journey to WordPress:</h3>\n<p>From the day when I had installed WordPress in my local host, my journey in this ecosystem started. I found it so easy to use and user-friendly that I felt anyone could create a website. I started to read articles and explore the World of WordPress. Also, weDevs’s internship program helped me a lot to get involved in the WordPress industry. My mentor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AfshanaDiya\">Afshana Diya</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mainul0aion\">Mainul Kabir Aion</a> guided me a lot to dive deep into the sea of WordPress. Learned the area of content marketing, explored paid mediums, gathered knowledge on social media marketing, and more within three months. The internship program was exact and compact, along with interactive.</p>\n<p>Here came another twist. I wanted to be a part of the Digital Marketing Team. But because of my communication skills and interpersonal relationship skills, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nizam5428\">Mr. Nizam Uddin</a> (Founder &amp; CEO at weDevs) offered me the Business Development executive position. It was an entirely new thing at weDevs. I was the one-man army in the Business Development Team. And it opened up a new world to me. At that time, I got my first chance to attend a WordCamp (WCAhmedabad, India 2018). From that time, I got the motive to be involved in the WordPress Community. I’ll share how WordCamps can help you to join the community closely. Later on, I got the chance to participate in WordCamp Kolkata 2019, WordCamp Nagpur 2019. It was a fantastic journey to join WordCamps in person. In 2019 I took part in WordCamp Dhaka as a volunteer.</p>\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Gtarafdar_WordCamps.jpg\"><img /></a>My Journey to WordCamps\n<p>I’d love to share with you; now, I have become part of the Digital Marketing Team of weDevs. After almost two years of my journey as a business development executive, I got this new opportunity to prove myself again. So I took this opportunity and became a Digital Strategist.</p>\n<p>Now I’m dedicatedly taking care of a sole product. It’s an Addon of Elementor Page Builder. It’s HappyAddons for Elementor. I’m the product coordinator of this excellent tool. From zero to now, 100k+ users are actively using this tool. It’s an incredible learning period in my career path. I learned how to grow a product from the ground level. It’s a great achievement for me as a Product Marketer.</p>\n<h3>How WordCamp Helps Me to Become a Member in the WordPress Community:</h3>\n<p>WordCamps are the place of like-minded people. When you are in touch with the right people under the same roof, you will get that homely feeling. Also, in WordCamps, you get to meet industry experts. Interestingly, you can collect lucrative swag items. To some extent, you will get an opportunity to make partnerships to expand the business. Moreover, some companies share job boxes where anyone can share their resume. So it could be a place of opportunities. Who knows what you will get. But in my case, I made so many friends. We are now close buddies.</p>\n<p>The exciting part, some WordCamps run contributors day. On that day, you will get the chance to know closely about how you can take part in the core programs of WordPress. From WordCamp Ahmedabad, I started participating in WordPress programs, also started joining WordPress teams meetings. I’ve become active on social media as well to spread news and updates related to WordPress.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enriching\">How I’m Enriching My Knowledge of WordPress:</h3>\n<p>One line changes my way of thinking. Once I was talking with our Founder &amp; CTO, Mr. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tareq_cse\">Tareq Hasan</a>, regarding this topic. He just said, “Gobinda, you don’t have to learn coding to solve the problems of WordPress; you have to gain the ability to solve the problem by anyhow. You can solve any kind of problem by referring to other WordPress Plugins and tools.”</p>\n<p>I got a new meaning of using WordPress. From that time, I have started to check WordPress plugins and themes to learn more about their purpose. WordPress repository now becomes a place of amusement for me. Sometimes, my colleagues refer to me as a ‘plugin man’ as I try to give a quick solution to WordPress-related problems with the help of WordPress plugins.</p>\n<p>Still, I’m participating in several Facebook Group discussions. Trying to solve several solutions and learning what problems are usually people facing while creating websites with WordPress. And believe me, there is definitely a solution to each particular problem.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You have to keep patience and search for the solution in the right type of keywords.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For example, yesterday on the Facebook group &#8211; WordPressian (Dedicated Facebook Group for those who speak Bangali), a person was looking to create a courier service platform where people can track their package. Most people suggested building a custom-made solution. But I know there is a solution; I randomly found it on the WP repository.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So I just googled this term “WordPress plugin: courier service”. Google didn’t disappoint me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I got my answer, read the description, reviewed, checked screenshots, and shared the solution with that person.</p>\n<p>To increase my knowledge of WordPress, I use another method. I use some Google Chrome Extensions for checking the Builtwith Materials of WordPress sites. When I jump on a WordPress site, I just click on the Chrome Ext. and check the plugins they’ve used to create their site. And it helps me a lot to learn the tools and their purposes. You can do that if you want to increase your knowledge of WordPress.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you have to create a site by yourself. Otherwise, you would not be able to know the issue on your own. At least create your own portfolio site. I have learned so many things while creating my portfolio site: gtarafdar.com. You will know some untold facts, and finally, you will get a boost. <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/\">Mr. Asif Rahman</a>, the founder of WP Developers, gave me this idea. He always inspires me to create a personal website. Also, he forced me to write about WordPress daily. Guided me on how I can create a site with Elementor in 2018. I became familiar with a handy tool that helps me create a site without having coding experiences from that time. Later on, it helped me to take over the Happy Elementor Addons Project.</p>\n<h3>How you can connect with WordPress Socially:</h3>\n<p>Twitter is the best medium. I opened my Twitter account in 2010. But I had no motivation to use it as I didn’t have people close to me there. My friends were all on Facebook. I was also trying to involve myself on Facebook. But after joining weDevs, I found my Mentor, Afshana Diya, was so active on Twitter, and she has so many like-minded people on Twitter, and most of them belong to the WordPress community. I got new motivation to use Twitter. I started to connect with WordPress Professionals. Also interacted with them regularly. And I must say it feels really amazing.</p>\n<p>I’ve prepared a Twitter<a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/lists/1143525711489036288\"> list of WordPress Influencers</a>. You can easily follow them from here.</p>\n<h3>How you can start your career at WordPress:</h3>\n<p>If you have a passion for coding, you could be a WordPress developer. In our region, here is a myth. To become a developer, you have to be a CSE grad. But it’s not true. Let’s check a fact. In our weDevs, most of the Developers are directly not from Computer Science Engineering backgrounds. In the same way, you may have joined the CSE program at an early stage, but now you may not have that much passion for coding. You can be a Product Manager. In the WordPress industry, there is scope for a Product manager as well. Another exciting sector is the Quality Assurance team. So many companies are hiring in this sector. Moreover, if you like to communicate with people, you can join the Support Engineering team. You can’t imagine how many job openings there are in the support engineering field.</p>\n<p>Those who don’t have any coding knowledge but are proficient in English and have a passion for writing can join as Content Marketers. There are plenty of job vacancies in the content marketing area.</p>\n<p>Another interesting option is joining the Designing team. If you find interest in the designing sector and love to play with the designing tools like Figma, Adobe Tools, Sketch, you can definitely join the design team of a WordPress company.</p>\n<p>Later on, other job sectors like HR management, Accounts, Business Development, and other necessary areas are also available on WordPress companies. More interestingly, you can work remotely in so many companies. WordPress founding company Automattic is running its whole operation remotely. You just have to find your perfect niche. Otherwise, you can be frustrated.</p>\n<p>I’ve prepared a list of <a href=\"https://gtarafdar.com/wpjobs/popular-wordpress-companies-to-apply-for-jobs/\">WordPress companies</a> where you can apply for jobs.</p>\n<p>Finally, don’t be frustrated, my mate. I often hear from my fellow friends and juniors always blame God, parents, and the government because of their unemployment problem. But when I reach them and personally request to gain some technical skills, they just run away most of the time. Not even reply to my messages anymore. Even some of them block me. Lol. Also, some other groups are available; they knock me for jobs and share their family issues, but when I ask them to learn more about web development, they just fly like a bat. I don’t know what their problem is. If you are in the same category, then my mate, you are in huge trouble. Change your mindset. Gain some skills. It could be anything. Try one by one. Then choose the best one for you. But again, don’t be frustrated. Keep focusing on your goal. And dive into it.</p>\n<h3>What’s The Challenge on Working in WordPress Industry:</h3>\n<p>I’ve shared all the positive things about joining the WordPress industry. But there is a significant challenge you have to face while you will join the community. In my region, very few people know WordPress. Only tech-savvy people are familiar with that. Even most of the people don’t have any prior knowledge about remote job life. I have personally experienced so many funny incidents. Last year when my family members found me in front of my Mac and sometimes talking with some people, sometimes in English, they found me as an alien in my house. Even most of the time, I failed to give proof of how the whole work was done. You will face the same situation if you belong to the rural area of Bangladesh. But don’t worry, I prepared a comic book on <a href=\"https://gtarafdar.com/book/e-book-describe-wordpress-to-non-techies/\">Describe WordPress To Non-Techies</a>. You can read the conversation with my Grandpa. I have tried to give an idea about WordPress. I hope this will help you to introduce WordPress to the non-tech guys.</p>\n<h3>How I’m Contributing to the WordPress Community and how you can start:</h3>\n<p>Usually, I try to attend the weekly meeting of WordPress teams. I have attended several coffee-talk sessions of WordPress Teams. It helps me join with the members. Also, I’m trying to contribute to the Polyglot team. I have started to give suggestions of translating WordPress in Bangla. But mostly, I contribute in different ways. I have conducted local WordPress meet-ups, volunteered on WordCamps. I spread the news and updates through my social media accounts. Help WordPress people to find jobs. Recently, I’ve started my YouTube Channel(Gtarafdarr). I have begun to create how-to tutorials on WordPress.</p>\n<p>If you want to join WordPress core teams, you will need a WordPress Slack Account. From here, you can join WordPress <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Slack</a>.</p>\n<p>From here, you will find the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meetings/\">meeting</a> schedules of different teams. Don’t get puzzled. You can sort out your desired teams and add the meeting reminders to your calendar.</p>\n<p>Everyone in the WordPress community is so helpful. If you find any difficulties, raise your hand and people will guide you in the right way.</p>\n<p>Also, there are so many WordPress Facebook communities. Some are locals, and few are international, like WordPress, Advanced WordPress, WordPress For Non-Techies by WPCrafter, The WP Admin Bar, WPLeague, WPBeginner Engage &#8211; WordPress Help for Non-Techies, etc. Local Communities are, WordPressians, Kolkata WordPress Community (WPKolkata), etc. You can join these groups to get help from experts. Also, you can help others if you know the answers of the queries.</p>\n<h3>This How WordPress Changed My Life</h3>\n<p>Finally, I’m really thankful to WordPress. Because of this community I have overseas friends. We talk and meet virtually. All of them are so helpful. I get new motivations to do something extraordinary in my daily routine. I’m thankful to my parents and my younger sister as they rely upon me. They help me to take the risk to chess my dream. I’m grateful to weDevs and Tareq Hasan, Nizam Uddin, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Asif2BD\">Asif Rahman</a>, Afshana Diya, Mainul Kabir Aion, and my friends Arif, Mayeen, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shahriar_na\">Shahriar</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reachmazharul\">Mazhar</a>, and so on. They all have played a significant role in helping me become Gtarafdar, a WordPress enthusiast. Also, thanks to the HeroPress team for reaching me and encouraging me to share my story here.</p>\n<p>I’m still learning about WordPress and have to go further. If you want to connect with me, you can follow me on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gtarafdarr\">@Gtarafdarr</a>. Let’s contribute to WordPress and hold the glory of the supreme power of an open-source platform.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-wordpress-has-changed-my-life-gtarafdar/\">How WordPress Has Changed My Life &#8211; Gtarafdar</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 06:42:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"Gobinda Tarafdar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: InstaWP Launches New Service for Disposable WordPress Testing Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119740\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:199:\"https://wptavern.com/instawp-launches-new-service-for-disposable-wordpress-testing-sites?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=instawp-launches-new-service-for-disposable-wordpress-testing-sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4526:\"<p>Competition in the sandboxing products space is heating with the entrance of <a href=\"https://instawp.io/\">InstaWP</a>, a new service for setting up disposable WordPress testing sites. Founder Vikas Singhal created the tool to provide a quick way to set up live testing sites online or to show something to a client or team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>InstaWP joins the ranks of services like <a href=\"https://tastewp.com/\">TasteWP</a> and <a href=\"https://wpsandbox.io/\">WPSandbox</a> but with a few unique options. At setup, users can select from WordPress versions back to 4.7 and may even choose to spin up a site using the latest beta or release candidate. Like other services, InstaWP allows you to choose your PHP version. The ability to disable WP cache and browser cache is coming soon. Users can create a custom name for their sites or leave it blank for a randomly generated name.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Free WordPress instances stay live for 8 hours, and users can link their accounts via email to extend it to 48 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>InstaWP, not to be confused with <a href=\"https://instantwp.com/\">InstantWP</a>, a local WordPress installation tool, was built on an nginx + Apache server without any containers. Singhal said he found containers to be too heavy for this particular use case. He runs a <a href=\"https://expresstech.io/\">WordPress plugin/theme shop</a> along with an&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justhyre.com/\">agency</a>&nbsp;on the side, both of which could benefit from InstaWP&rsquo;s quick testing sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I wanted to build a solution for ourselves where we can quickly launch WP instances for a variety of reasons &ndash; testing a feature of WP, testing a plugin/theme, testing in different versions of WP/PHP and last but not the least &ndash; creating an &lsquo;instant&rsquo; test environment for the clients for them to test our plugins/themes,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Singhal started InstaWP a month ago and received so much positive feedback on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/o8cxwj/instawp_launch_a_disposable_wp_instantly_free/\">Reddit</a> and from the <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/poststatus/453?e=de2e3e61f2\">Post Status community</a> that he hired two dedicated developers to work on the project. Testers have commented on how fast the service spins up sites. Version <a href=\"http://next.expresstech.io/instawp/updates/939abf2f-c532-4abc-b701-eec9f89b6fda\">1.1.0</a> introduced Slack integration, which allows users to instantly set up a site by typing /wp in Slack. The release also added WordPress admin auto login for quick access without username and password.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>InstaWP has a <a href=\"https://next.expresstech.io/instawp\">public road map</a>. Features on deck for future releases include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Slack and cli commands</li><li>Download Files and DB Backup from the UI</li><li>Direct push to FTP or cPanel</li><li>nginx and nginx + Apache configurations</li><li>Finer controls on PHP settings</li><li>Save configurations for instant launch of pre-configured WP</li><li>Integrations with hosting providers</li><li>Map custom domains</li><li>Multiple servers around the world (USA, Singapore, London, etc.)</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Singhal said he was aware of TasteWP as a competitor but plans to differentiate InstaWP based on simplicity and feature set. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;My vision with InstaWP is make it a default tool for WP learners, enthusiasts, freelancers, and agencies &ndash; basically everyone,&rdquo; he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Singhal plans to monetize the tool for both end-users and plugin and theme authors. Users will have to upgrade to gain access to increased limits, custom domains, FTP access, and the ability to reserve a site. WordPress product authors can upgrade to provide 1-click demos to their clients and prospective customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Singhal said so far more than 500 instances have been created and teams from Yoast and some agencies are already using the tool. Several prominent WordPress businesses have requested agency pricing that would allow their users to test their plugins via a 1-click preconfigured install. The service is still under active development and Singhal plans to iron out pricing in the near future. Testers who have suggestions for InstaWP can log them on the tool&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://next.expresstech.io/instawp#/ideas\">idea board</a> for future consideration.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 04:25:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: Duotone Filters: WordPress 5.8 Puts a Powerful Image-Editing Tool Into Users’ Hands\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119885\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:227:\"https://wptavern.com/duotone-filters-wordpress-5-8-puts-a-powerful-image-editing-tool-into-users-hands?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=duotone-filters-wordpress-5-8-puts-a-powerful-image-editing-tool-into-users-hands\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4769:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Features such as the upcoming <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/diving-into-wordpress-5-8s-new-widgets-screen\">block-based widgets system</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/getting-to-know-the-upcoming-wordpress-5-8-template-editor\">the template editor</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/query-loop-the-ins-and-outs-of-one-of-wordpress-5-8s-most-powerful-features\">theme-related blocks</a>, and others have taken up much of the spotlight as of late. However, one of the best user-focused tools shipping with WordPress 5.8 is a duotone filter for Image and Cover blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term &ldquo;duotone&rdquo; in this sense means combining two colors as a filter. Then, layering it over an image or video. More specifically, one color is used for the shadows (dark elements), and the second color is used for the highlights (light colors).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the feature first <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-6-adds-duotone-filters-query-pattern-carousel-and-most-used-tags-selector\">landed in Gutenberg 10.6</a> back in May, I spent a couple of hours just tinkering around with it on that first day. Since then, I have racked up a few more. It is a powerful media-editing tool that does not require users to dive into image-editing programs, allowing them to change the mood of a story at the click of a button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duotones can be anything from a simple grayscale to a mixture of any two colors. Shadows and highlights can even be inverted, depending on the shades chosen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following shows the difference between an original image of kittens (<em>because who doesn&rsquo;t love kittens?</em>) and one with a grayscale filter:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"juxtapose\"><img id=\"119947\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kittens-orig.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1792\" height=\"1008\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" /><img id=\"119948\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kittens-gray.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1793\" height=\"1008\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" /></div>Original image vs. grayscale duotone version.\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress offers a set of eight duotone color sets by default. This includes a grayscale, dark grayscale, and various combinations, making for some fun filters. Some will work better than others, often depending on the media file uploaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Applying the WordPress purple and yellow duotone filter.\n\n\n\n<p>Like many other features awaiting users with WordPress 5.8, theme authors are those who need to dig in to offer a range of ready-baked options for users. The new <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/fse-outreach-round-8-a-developer-centric-call-for-testing-theme-json-configuration\">theme JSON file configuration</a> allows developers to define a set of duotone colors that match their theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defining custom duotone filters is as easy as plugging a name, a slug, and two colors into a <code>theme.json</code> file. The theme developer handbook includes <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/#presets\">examples of creating such presets</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom &ldquo;emerald scale&rdquo; duotone filter from a theme.\n\n\n\n<p>Users are not limited to the filters that WordPress or their themes offer. The duotone popover allows them to choose from any range of colors for custom shadows and highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duotone typically works best when an image has a high contrast, which means a wide-ranging spread between the light and dark colors. Darker shadows and lighter highlights make for more visually stunning filters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When used with the Cover block, users can add filters to both image and video backgrounds. However, they also have access to the typical overlay color or gradient option. This provides a ton of flexibility for customizing media.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Duotone filter + gradient overlay on a Cover block.\n\n\n\n<p>Because the duotone feature works with an inline SVG file under the hood, it also means that using it does not permanently change image or video files. Users can still use their original media elsewhere on the site without uploading a second copy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duotone is just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many other possibilities outside of just laying a couple of colors on top of an image. Bence Szab&oacute; wrote an extensive tutorial on using <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/creating-patterns-with-svg-filters/\">SVG filters for patterns</a> on CSS-Tricks.

The company advocates for open source software, open source hardware, and open data, while providing a central point of collaboration for people working in the open sectors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The State of the Open report offers a broad overview of the UK&rsquo;s open source ecosystem. This collection of research includes surveys of UK companies, interviews, industry reports, and analysis from different publications. It was sponsored by GitHub, SUSE, and the Open Invention Network, and conducted by <a href=\"http://smoothmedia.com/\">Smoothmedia</a> consulting firm under the direction of ethnographer and social researcher Dr. Jennifer Barth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key findings in <a href=\"https://openuk.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/openuk_stateofope2021_report_FINALCHANGES_08.pdf\">Phase 1</a> of the report include research demonstrating that open source software contributes an estimated &pound;43.1 billion to the UK economy, with the UK ringing in as Europe&rsquo;s largest contributor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openuk.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/State-of-Open-Phase-Two.pdf\">Phase 2</a> covers open source adoption in the UK. Researchers found a staggering 97% of the 273 UK businesses surveyed use some form of open source software:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We found that 97% of businesses of different sizes in all sectors of the UK economy use open source software technology. Although resources became a more pressing concern during the pandemic, 64% of businesses in our sample experienced business growth which translated into a high recruitment drive for roles relating to open source software in the past 12 months (see recruitment findings). Further, we find that almost half of businesses surveyed (48%) are using open source software more as digital adoption becomes embedded in organisational culture and business.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Other key findings from Phase 2 include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>53% of non-tech organizations contribute to open source software projects</li><li>77% of UK public sector looks to open source for skills developmen </li><li>Over half (54%) have written policies and processes for open source contributions</li><li>89% run open source software internally in their business</li><li>Approximately two thirds (65%) contribute to open source software projects</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting observation from the contribution data is that smaller companies are more likely to contribute back to open source than larger companies. Smaller companies are also more likely to use open source software in their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">From the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StateOfOpen?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#StateOfOpen</a> report from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/openuk_uk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@openuk_uk</a>, it\'s clear that businesses of all sizes make key use of open source.

This report will focus on UK data with a methodology tailored to reveal the value of open source software to the digital economy.

Taking a weekend-afternoon deep dive into creating custom block types meant learning some tough lessons and familiarizing myself with a programming language I had little experience using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Programming has always been a trial-and-error affair for me: write code, refresh the browser, read the error message, and attempt to fix the problem. Then, simply rinse and repeat the process until the program is not broken. Those mistakes are woven into the art of coding, the layers underneath that poetry on the visible canvas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have absolutely made the same mistake twice. And, thrice. Probably a lot more than that if I am being honest with myself and you. Eventually, I stop making those same mistakes, and some method or procedure is permanently seared into my brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have written a few hundred WordPress tutorials in the past decade and a half. I am a twice-published author of development books and served as a tech editor on another. However, I am not much of a reader of tech books and documentation. For one, programmers are not necessarily the most engaging writers. Plus, <em>book smarts</em> can only get you so far. You need the <em>street smarts</em> of programming to become good at it, which means learning from experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I firmly believe that reading is a central part of that, there is no replacement for getting your hands dirty. Building things, making mistakes, and learning to fix them is what makes programming fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working on open-source software like WordPress is one of the best ways to do that. There is no upfront cost, assuming you have access to a computer, a prerequisite to programming of any kind. There are usually people willing to lend a hand or answer questions, and there are always problems to solve for those ready to dive into them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress Executive Director <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/the-commons-of-images/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy chatted with Matt Mullenweg</a> on the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/openverse-why-this-project-is-good-for-wordpress-and-the-web\">Openverse project</a> a couple of months ago, there was a moment that I found myself nodding my head in agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Because, of course, you know, contributing and being involved with open source is probably the best way to learn a technology, better than any college degree.</p><cite><em>Matt Mullenweg, WordPress Project Lead</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I have learned more about WordPress, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by contributing to open-source software than I ever learned in a college course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I grew up in a generation that was told that we must get a college degree. It was an integral part of the American dream that would result in suburban life in a neighborhood with perfectly aligned rows of houses, ending in a cul-de-sac. It was the first step toward a two-car garage, white-picket-fence, 2.5 kids, and a dog. College was the promise that my peers and I hinged everything on. It was expected of us, and so many of us did our duty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the thing that our parents did not know. The internet would change everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I graduated high school in 2002. This was during that stretch where the online world was exploding. All of the world&rsquo;s knowledge would soon be at our fingertips. Today that is truer than ever. Anything you will ever need to learn about writing code is available through an internet connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My experience with college-level courses in programming was mixed, but I learned a necessary life lesson from them: I was not cut out for a degree in software engineering. I am glad I wised up early on and pursued a different degree, saving myself some time and money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rocked my half-summer C programming class, my introduction to writing code. I also had a passionate professor who once worked on U.S. missile projects as a bug-tester. It was probably not the most glamorous job, but he always made it sound exciting because he loved what he was doing. Our class was tasked with building various programs throughout the course, but we usually had a choice in what we were building. For my group&rsquo;s final project, we created vending machine software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was on the fast track to becoming a software engineer after that first class. I had built a way for merchants to get paid for delivering sugary treats and soft drinks to customers. It was capitalism meeting programming, and I had a taste for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fall semester rolled around, and I was motivated to move beyond the realm of procedural programming in C. Java, an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, would be my next challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most advanced thing our class built for an entire semester was a basic calculator. I skipped nearly every lecture because I could not stay awake watching the professor chicken-peck his way through programs for three hours every week. I attended the mandatory &ldquo;labs&rdquo; &mdash; basically a fancy way of saying an extra class where the professor&rsquo;s assistants would teach the actual coursework. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, my fire died down. While calculator programs are handy tools, I wanted to branch out and build things that mattered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You know what reignited my flame for programming?</em> At first, it was general web development. But, WordPress was what I really became passionate about. And, I have not looked back since I started using it in 2005.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress was my gateway into a world where I could create things that interested me. I could jump ahead into a project far more advanced than my skill level, trial-and-error my way ahead, and eventually build something that others found value in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless universities have changed, most teach step-by-step foundational lessons to their pupils. Some students may luck out and land in that unique professor&rsquo;s class who gives them leeway to explore various ideas. However, there is no substitute for creating something of your own, solving a problem that you see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, that is what programming is all about &mdash; solving problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2007, I released my first WordPress plugin into the wild. It automatically listed all of the subpages of the currently-viewed page. Dozens of similar plugins have been written since and probably before (<em>it seems WordPress would have a simple &ldquo;list subpages&rdquo; function by now</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, after writing a new plugin, I was reminded of the free education that the WordPress community has given me over the years. Some of it has been reading documentation. Some from WordPress Stack Exchange answers. Other bits have been studying from those who came before me, building upon their open-source code. All of it was from other people giving something back to our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not necessarily a knock on college.  Some people perform better in that structured environment, and there is value in all forms of education. However, there are alternatives for those who cannot afford college or learn better in a different environment.

An early version of this was the Latest Post Block. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design team also implemented a series of Block Patterns of a few nice variations to display a post list on templates, post and pages.

The release is geared up to be the most feature-packed update the community has seen in a while. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/diving-into-wordpress-5-8s-new-widgets-screen\">Block-based widgets</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-beta-1-released-new-blocks-new-widgets-screen-and-pattern-directory-on-deck\">the pattern directory</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-introduces-support-for-webp-images\">WebP image support</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/getting-to-know-the-upcoming-wordpress-5-8-template-editor\">template-editing mode</a>, and many more tools are nearly ready to ship to the masses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, one of the most powerful features is the Query Loop block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are unfamiliar with the terms &ldquo;Query&rdquo; and &ldquo;Loop,&rdquo; they are vital concepts within WordPress. Traditionally, they were only necessary for theme and plugin development. However, through the Query Loop block, users will gain exposure to what is, for all intents and purposes, the backbone of how WordPress displays posts on a site&rsquo;s front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Queries? Loops?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Not everyone will be immediately familiar with these developer terms that WordPress is plopping down in the user interface. For theme and plugin authors, these are everyday concepts. However, even some users who have been using the platform for a decade have never been exposed to them. So, we should get some basic definitions in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term &ldquo;Query&rdquo; is simpler than you might think. It merely means to &ldquo;query&rdquo; or &ldquo;ask&rdquo; for posts from the database according to a defined set of options. For example, one might attempt to get the last 10 blog posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Loop&rdquo; is an even easier concept to grasp. It means to &ldquo;loop&rdquo; or &ldquo;cycle&rdquo; through each queried post and output it. Technically, a developer could do things other than displaying the posts during this process, but we are only concerned with what gets printed on the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two things combined become the Query Loop block. It allows users to ask for a set of posts and display each one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a Post Template block, which throws a wrinkle in all of this. Aside from the word &ldquo;template&rdquo; being overused in WordPress for various features, this is a new method for an old concept. Traditionally, WordPress theme authors would write out all the HTML and call specific template tags within the queried posts loop to show things like the post title, author, content, and more. This is easy to do within a PHP file. However, in the block editor, there needed to be a new way to group these things together. The Post Template block acts as this group, housing the things users want to display in the Query Loop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress also has a variation on the Query Loop block called Posts List. They do the same thing, but the latter has a more user-friendly title than the former. The only problem with this variation is that, when it is inserted, the user still sees the same &ldquo;Query Loop&rdquo; block title. There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/32268\">ticket to fix this</a>, but it is unlikely to make it into WordPress 5.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Query Loop Pattern Inserter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">When first inserting a Query Loop into the editor, WordPress will introduce users to another version 5.8 feature: the pattern inserter. Instead of having immediate access to interact with the block, users can select from a list of predefined patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, the inserter is a carousel that lets users can scroll through patterns individually:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Query Loop pattern inserter: carousel view.\n\n\n\n<p>However, they can switch to a grid-based layout and view all of the patterns at once:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Query Loop pattern inserter: grid view.\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 is set to ship with six Query Loop patterns by default, unless more are added in the coming days:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Standard</li><li>Image at left</li><li>Small image and title</li><li>Grid</li><li>Large title</li><li>Offset</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not particularly fond of any of the default patterns other than the &ldquo;Large title&rdquo; one (shown in the screenshots above with the black background and white text). For this block to shine, users will need to build out their own designs or wait for theme authors to begin bundling custom Query Loop patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, that is how it should be. Core WordPress should ship some basics while letting our community of theme designers showcase their craft.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />A custom simple blog posts listing.\n\n\n\n<p>This is also an opportunity for theme authors to offer alternatives to their custom page template designs. It is not time to throw them out entirely. However, it is a way to begin recreating old ideas in the block era, such as building out eCommerce plugin integrations, portfolio grids, and much more. Some of the tools are still limited (we are getting to those next), but there is enough initial groundwork for exploration, helping users experience WordPress in new ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Options</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Query Loop block has several options for users to customize which posts to <em>query</em> the database for:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Query Loop block and its options.\n\n\n\n<p>In the block toolbar, there is a &ldquo;Display settings&rdquo; button. When clicked, it creates a popover with options for how many posts to show:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Items per Page:</strong> Number of posts to display per page</li><li><strong>Offset:</strong> Number of posts to skip over</li><li><strong>Max page to show:</strong> Limit pages (this requires using one of the Query Pagination blocks)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; panel in the Query Loop&rsquo;s block sidebar has several secondary options. Users can enable &ldquo;Inherit query from template&rdquo; to use WordPress&rsquo;s global query, but this is mostly useless for WordPress 5.8 users without the Gutenberg plugin enabled and a block-based theme. For now, you will almost always want to disable this option. This will grant access to a slew of new choices, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Post type</li><li>Ordering</li><li>Filters panel for categories, tags, author, and keyword</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Settings and Filters panels are the most fine-tuned pieces of the Query Loop block. The development team struck a sensible balance between ease-of-use and the dozens of query-related parameters available through code. It provides users with a ton of power right of the gate but should be flexible enough in the future for plugin authors to extend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Post Template</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">When inserting a Query Loop, the editor automatically adds its inner Post Template block. This is where most of the magic happens. Users can directly change how their posts appear. Primarily, they will do so by adding blocks from the Theme category, many of which are for outputting post-related data.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Theme-categorized blocks for outputting dynamic data.\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly all other blocks are available for insertion here too. However, many of them will not be great candidates for use within the Query Loop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that may not be immediately evident is that changes you make to one post within the Post Template block will affect all others. So, if you add a Video or Buttons block here, they will be identical. Remember, this is a &ldquo;template&rdquo; for designing how all posts within the Query Loop will appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drawback for customizing the Post Template block output is the lack of design options for some of the blocks. It is easy to build something like a simple post list:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Posts list with titles and dates.\n\n\n\n<p>You can also build a layout like a portfolio project grid, as shown in the following screenshot. However, the Post Featured Image block does not currently have sizing controls, so you are stuck with your theme&rsquo;s default post-thumbnail size &mdash; assuming it is actually registered. <em>Experiences may vary. Wildly.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<img />Building a basic portfolio grid.\n\n\n\n<p>For more advanced things than changing typography, colors, and spacing, users will need to wait for WordPress 5.9 and beyond. However, theme authors still have the block styles API at their disposal. I, for one, look forward to seeing what they do with it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 05:17:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"WPTavern: WordPress.org Meta Team Fixes Search Snippet Issue with Download Page Promoting WordPress.com\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119785\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:251:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-meta-team-fixes-search-snippet-issue-with-download-page-promoting-wordpress-com?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-org-meta-team-fixes-search-snippet-issue-with-download-page-promoting-wordpress-com\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4709:\"<p>Yesterday evening Chris Klosowski, Sandhills Development Partner and Director of Technology, tweeted out a problem with the way WordPress.org&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\">Download page</a> was appearing in Google&rsquo;s Search results snippets when searching for &ldquo;WordPress.&rdquo; Underneath the link, the preview text referenced WordPress.com&rsquo;s hosting: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>WordPress.com is the easiest way to create a free website or blog.

No changes have been announced for the plugin and Awesome Motive CEO Syed Balkhi says it will be &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; for current customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We have built a lot of internal tools to improve our website search that I&rsquo;m really looking forward to sharing with the WordPress community,&rdquo; Balkhi said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We will be combining Jon&rsquo;s vision with our own experience, so you can literally have the best search plugin in the industry without the high costs.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, when Jon Christopher launched SearchWP, he quickly carved out a slice of the WordPress search market among early competitors. The freemium model was already popular in those days with plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/relevanssi/\">Relevanssi</a>, but Christopher chose to launch SearchWP as a commercial-only product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There was already freemium competition, and I felt that the pricing model (which is the same today) was stronger given the product itself,&rdquo; Christopher said. &ldquo;I saw the pricing model as something that would help SearchWP stand out, and I also wanted to avoid opening the doors to overwhelming amounts of support requests right from the start. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I had no idea if SearchWP would be successful given the landscape, I built it first to scratch my own itch while knowing that even if no one bought it, I would 100% use it in my own work, and use it&nbsp;<em>a lot</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His gamble paid off and the plugin has been used on more than 30,000 WordPress sites. Christopher had one support contractor but otherwise had been running the business alone for the past eight years. WordPress&rsquo; growing market share has made one-person plugin businesses difficult to maintain once they become very popular, as seen in the recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/delicious-brains-acquires-advanced-custom-fields-plugin\">sale of ACF to Delicious Brains</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I was looking ahead and considering what would be best for SearchWP&rsquo;s customers,&rdquo; Christopher said. &ldquo;I want SearchWP to live as long as it possibly can. If I&rsquo;m by myself it&rsquo;s a bit of a risk to continue that way as the business continues to grow. I know that I prefer to build things from the ground up, and I also know that I&rsquo;m not the guy to build (or manage) a team, it&rsquo;s not my strong suit. Given all of those pieces it was clear to me that it was a good time to consider selling.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christopher described the 2013 WordPress ecosystem as more &ldquo;scrappy,&rdquo; as developers launched product businesses and worked to figure it out along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There are pros and cons to an environment like that, but it was fantastic from my perspective,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Over time that feeling went away as companies grew, matured, and playbooks began to take shape. That cycle has continued over time and especially in the last 18 months we&rsquo;re getting a look at where WordPress is headed &ndash; lots of big players in a really big space.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are jumping into the waters with a new product business, Christopher underscored the need for strong marketing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think that a lack of serious marketing will in fact be a limiter in today&rsquo;s WordPress economy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Products that have been around a long time have a natural momentum that&rsquo;s really tough to beat, but that momentum doesn&rsquo;t come without friction. In order to keep up with where WordPress is going, I do feel like you need assets (and capital) aimed directly and solely at marketing for the long haul.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Balkhi did not elaborate on Awesome Motive&rsquo;s immediate plans for the search plugin but said the company will be executing on a 12-month plan to make it easier for beginners and non-technical business owners to set up in less than 10 minutes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 09 Jul 2021 03:17:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 11.0 Includes Over 70 Bug Fixes, Continues Improving With WordPress 5.8 Just Two Weeks Away\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119703\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:265:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-11-0-includes-over-70-bug-fixes-continues-improving-with-wordpress-5-8-just-two-weeks-away?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-11-0-includes-over-70-bug-fixes-continues-improving-with-wordpress-5-8-just-two-weeks-away\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6795:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 11.0 landed yesterday with a pile of changes. The development team has been moving fast, and it shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a two-week cycle, version 11.0 includes an insane number of bug fixes. Contributors squashed over 70 in this release alone. This seems to be in preparation for WordPress 5.8, which is expected to land on July 20. The upcoming block-based Widgets screen had the lion&rsquo;s share of bugs. However, the block library had nearly two dozen, many of those issues with new theme-related blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside of such a massive release is that there are too many features and not enough time to cover them all. I will be cherry-picking some of my favorites, but feel free to dive into the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v11.0.0\">release notes</a> for a complete picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Theme and Template-Editing Mode Changes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">One of the primary Full Site Editing features making its way to WordPress 5.8 will be disabled by default for most users. In a rare move from the core project, the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32858\">template editor will be opt-in</a>, at least for users with classic themes.  It is opt-out for block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/getting-to-know-the-upcoming-wordpress-5-8-template-editor\">wrote last month</a>, until users are on actual block themes, the template editor is &ldquo;a sort-of-OK-but-kind-of-amazing landing page creator.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Template-editing is really only as good as the weakest link in the system. This will almost always be the theme over the next few months. Because the template editor is a new feature that directly attempts to overwrite the front-end output, it will always be at odds with many themes that were never designed with it in mind. The opt-in approach is unlikely the best route to mass adoption, but it is in the interest of the user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making it opt-in also allows theme authors to make template editing a smooth experience. Gutenberg 11.0 introduces a new <code>defaultBlockTemplate</code> editor setting. Theme authors can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32771\">create the default blocks</a> that users begin with when creating a new template.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Starting with a custom default block template.\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, this default template should include some base layout components, such as a header, footer, and post/page content. However, themers are free to put their own spin on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on creating default block templates, theme authors should read Themes Team rep Carolina Nymark&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2021/07/08/summary-theme-features-in-wordpress-5-8/\">overview of WordPress 5.8 theme features</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Media &amp; Text Block: Drag-and-Drop Media Replacement</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Dragging a new media file into the Media &amp; Text block.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Users have long been able to drag and drop an initial image or video into the Media &amp; Text block. However, they were unable to replace it using the same method. Gutenberg 11.0 creates a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29710\">&ldquo;drop zone&rdquo; over the media column</a>, making it easy to change the media to something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature already exists with the Cover and Image blocks, so this change brings Media &amp; Text up to date. We probably should have had this feature months ago, but the patch sat in limbo waiting for a code review.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Accessibility: Categories Dropdown Has Label</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Label difference between the Archives and Categories blocks.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The development team added a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33060\">&ldquo;Categories&rdquo; label</a> when the Categories block is shown as a dropdown. This is a welcome improvement to help those using screen-readers better navigate the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with this change is the lack of consistency. In <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-8-adds-new-typography-controls-and-block-previews\">Gutenberg 10.8</a>, the team removed the <code>.screen-reader-text</code> class for the Archives block label, making it appear on screen for all users. These types of inconsistencies that seem trivial on the surface tend to pile up, creating code bloat for theme designers in the long run as they try to wrangle them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would prefer both labels to be marked as screen-reader text. Regardless of the default, the two should match. Then, throw in an option for the end-user to decide whether to show the label similar to how the Search form handles it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Return of Post Classes</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Post classes appear for Post Template block.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For those theme designers who need them, Gutenberg 11.0 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/30497\">brings back post classes</a>. If you are wondering where posts classes had gone, you may not be alone. In the world of blocks, they are not needed as much as they once were. Traditionally, WordPress theme authors used these classes to dynamically change the output of a post based on contexts such as type, format, category, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Post Template block (formerly named Query Loop) was introduced, there was a noticeable lack of the traditional classes attached to the wrapper for individual posts. This latest update brings them back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, block themes will likely rely on these classes less and less. With much of the design configuration moving to <code>theme.json</code> files and user-controlled options, it is probably time to say goodbye to one of the core features of theme design over the past decade. However, it is a comfort to know it is there when needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Decimals Allowed in Spacing Controls</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For those who are particular about getting their margin and padding <em>just</em> right, they can finally rejoice. Spacing controls now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32692\">allow for decimal values</a> and not just whole numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In past versions of the plugin, a value such as <code>1.5</code> would be rounded up to <code>2</code>. When used with <code>rem</code> and <code>em</code> units, such rounding created a 50% difference between the intended spacing and reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am happy about this one.

I even began building one years ago before ultimately abandoning it for a simple Markdown solution in a private repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes Hypernotes unique is its handling of &ldquo;folders,&rdquo; which essentially work like categories. However, each folder gets its own sub-menu link under the Notes section in the WordPress admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Hypernotes&rsquo; folder system.\n\n\n\n<p>This more closely mimics other note-taking apps where users can switch between various folders to quickly find notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The code to make this happen is simple; the idea is ingenious. It is the sort of outside-the-box thinking I love to see from plugin developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few trivial issues with it, such as the folder names not being highlighted when viewing their screens. However, that is a WordPress-specific bug. A simple dash before each folder name could spruce up the UI a bit too. They sit below the &ldquo;All Notes&rdquo; menu item, so it would create more of a folder effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, the plugin works well as a note-taking application.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Writing a note in the WordPress editor.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin description does have a security note for users who are wondering just how private their content is:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Only you will be able to see your notes within the WordPress admin, but the notes are NOT encrypted at the moment, so anyone with database access will be able to read them.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypernotes also ensures that no post is ever accidentally published for all the world to see. Under the hood, it automatically sets all notes to the &ldquo;private&rdquo; status. The plugin&rsquo;s post type cannot be publicly queried on the front end either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the plugin does not create custom capabilities (permissions) for its post type and taxonomy. Any registered user on the site with the right post-editing capabilities can access others&rsquo; notes in the backend, such as people with the Editor role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is unlikely an issue given the nature of the plugin. I imagine the primary audience will be made up of solo bloggers who want a simple note-taking solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ran into one not-so-trivial issue when I began trying out Hypernotes, believing my website was broken. This is usually because of a patch I am testing for the Gutenberg plugin or just one of its run-of-the-mill updates. However, the typical culprit was not to blame. After a half-hour or so trying to figure out why my theme styles were not appearing for Note posts, I finally cracked the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypernotes disables all theme editor styles. The beautiful typography of my currently active theme was gone, which would work well with a note or journaling plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was easy enough to overrule with a few lines of custom code. If I was going to save a few quotes that I liked as personal notes, I at least wanted to do it in style:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Bringing back my theme&rsquo;s custom quotes style.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin also attempts to disable wide/full alignment and theme editor font sizes. The code it uses works for traditional WordPress themes but not for block themes, which have a different mechanism for registering such support. This was also one of the reasons it was tough to track down the issue. Everything else from my theme was working but custom editor styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand the idea behind removing support for those features. Themes design the front end of the site, and Hypernotes is purely a backend tool. However, I would rather see an option for letting the user control what gets disabled. Some theme editor styles would pair well with the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disabling these features has other implications too. For example, all of my theme&rsquo;s custom block style variations were registered and usable from the editor. However, because my styles were not loaded, they did not work correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option would be for the plugin to provide its own editor styles. There would still be some complications going that route, such as the block style variations issue, but the plugin could become a beautifully designed note-taking app in its own right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a version 1.0 outing, I am a fan of the simplicity. More so, I am impressed with the clever method of handling note &ldquo;folders.&rdquo; I am eager to see how this plugin evolves over future iterations.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Jul 2021 03:13:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Matt: Open Insulin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=54516\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://ma.tt/2021/07/open-insulin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:895:\"<p>One of my big themes is that open source will transform every industry, with key examples being WordPress in web publishing, WooCommerce in online commerce, Wikipedia in reference, and Bitcoin/Ethereum in finance.

It also makes it possible to add a bearded man or a bearded woman in all skin tone variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 will also include significant changes to the syringe emoji that were committed to a previous version of Twemoji (13.0.2) earlier this year. Instead of a blood-filled barrel accented with drops of blood leaking out of the tip, the new syringe emoji contains a non-specific liquid. This makes it more flexible for use cases that don&rsquo;t involve removing blood. Emojipedia has a fascinating look at <a href=\"https://blog.emojipedia.org/vaccine-emoji-comes-to-life/\">the syringe emoji&rsquo;s history</a>, dating back to 1999 when it was primarily used in Japan for blood donation. A 2021 refresh on the syringe makes it possible for it to be used in reference to vaccines, a topic of public conversation across the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to changes to the syringe, Jonathan Desrosiers, who opened the trac ticket to initiate the update, summarized a few other changes from previous Twemoji versions that modify existing emoji:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cricket: the colors have been adjusted to improve readability on small screens and to prevent confusion with other Emoji that had a similar color.</li><li>T-Rex: The color and posture of the T-Rex has been adjusted.</li><li>Portuguese flag: A line within the flag&rsquo;s circle has been corrected.</li><li>Thai flag: The proportions of the stripes for this flag have been corrected.</li><li>Fox face: The symmetry has been improved.</li><li>Transgender flag: The lines have been updated to prevent small gaps between stripes from showing when rendered with antialiasing.</li><li>Rolling on the floor laughing: Adjusted to be less exaggerated and appear more natural.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The official emoji lexicon is constantly being tweaked and updated for accuracy, and to better serve conversations, as current events increase demand for visual representations of specific objects and emotions. Although many of these updates and new additions may seem pandemic-inspired, there&rsquo;s a lengthy, official process for proposing changes to the Unicode Consortium. The Unicode Emoji Subcommittee reviews <a href=\"https://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html\">proposals</a>, which require compelling data on compatibility, expected usage level, distinctiveness, and other factors. Candidates approved for inclusion do not arrive to major platforms for approximately a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 will bump Twemoji from 13.0.1 to 13.1.0. Unicode 14.0, the next major update, is expected for release in late 2021. Emojipedia has a <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/emoji-14.0/\">draft list</a> of what is on deck for the next version and those that are approved would likely make it to major platforms by the end of 2022.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Jul 2021 05:16:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 9.9 Released With a Refreshed Image Gallery Carousel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119629\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:185:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-9-9-released-with-a-refreshed-image-gallery-carousel?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=jetpack-9-9-released-with-a-refreshed-image-gallery-carousel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3094:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Today, Automattic <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2021/07/06/jetpack-9-9-make-your-best-photos-shine/\">released version 9.9</a> of its popular Jetpack plugin. The development team improved the modal animation and transition speed for the Instant Search module and added the Social Preview panel to the pre-publish sidebar. However, the most notable user-facing update was a refresh of its Carousel feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The module creates a fullscreen overlay gallery of a post&rsquo;s images once one is clicked. Users can <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/carousel/\">enable this feature</a> via the Jetpack &gt; Settings &gt; Writing page in the WordPress admin. Users can also turn on the display of EXIF data and the media attachment commenting form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack Carousel handles Image and Gallery blocks a bit differently. Regardless of whether Gallery images are linked or not, they will always be included in the image carousel when clicked. However, only Image blocks that specifically link to the attachment page are added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have never much cared for the Jetpack Carousel feature. There were always prettier image-overlay, lightbox-type solutions out in the wild. We use the plugin here at WP Tavern, so it is just something I have learned to live with. There was no sense in installing <em>yet another</em> plugin when we were already using the massive mono-project to run many other features on the site. And, it generally got the job done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, today, I can finally say that I am happy with the implementation. It is cleaner, offers a larger viewing area for individual images, and tucks unnecessary bits away for the average user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following is a screenshot of the carousel in all its fullscreen wonder:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Jetpack carousel in version 9.9.\n\n\n\n<p>For comparison, here is what the same image slide looks like in Jetpack 9.8.1:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Jetpack carousel in version 9.8.1.\n\n\n\n<p>In the new version, the image metadata and commenting form are hidden by default. The user must click the info or comment icon buttons to slide each section open. This is a better implementation because it decreases the noise in the carousel while still making the features available for those who want them.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Image metadata in the carousel.\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I am enjoying this update. Swiping and scrolling through the gallery feels smoother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would love for WordPress to bring a standard set of functions and blocks for displaying media metadata to the development community. Every plugin and theme author who wants to showcase that info must build a custom system for their projects, such as formatting aperture, shutter speed, and focal length. The following is the output of an image attachment page from a theme I have worked on:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom theme image info.\n\n\n\n<p>There is no reason that the theme and Jetpack should be working with custom wrappers for the metadata. WordPress stores EXIF and ID3 tags automatically.

I closed all the windows, shuttered the blinds, switched on a couple of fans for white noise, and clicked the television on. My cats and I relaxed. It is my job to keep them calm while my &mdash; usually drunken &mdash; compatriots burn hundreds of dollars away in the night sky. It is my ritual, and I enjoy it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this holiday, we re-watched Season 1 of <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em>, and I learned how to build a block plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was not my first attempt. When the block editor launched nearly three years ago, I tinkered with a few block type ideas. However, I never got far. Documentation was sparse, and I had almost no experience with JavaScript beyond building trivial bells and whistles for front-end design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaving my day job as a developer to write for WP Tavern also meant limited time to learn block development. And, my free time for the last couple of years has been filled with other projects. Lately, I have had the urge to jump back in and start building things for fun once again. My extended sabbatical from development work gave me time to pursue other interests while allowing my well of creativeness a chance to refill. The break did me some good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With time to kill yesterday afternoon, I dove right in. After a couple of hours of reading docs, studying other developers&rsquo; code, and breaking things, I had a functional block for a breadcrumbs list.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom block registered and ready to insert.\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus Kazmierczak&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/copyright-block/\">Copyright Block</a> plugin helped me get over one of the initial humps. It was helpful to see real-world, non-example code written in vanilla JavaScript to get to the meat of how the system worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>My overall thoughts on building custom block types?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was easier than I thought it would be. <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/\">Documentation</a> is, at the same time, both overwhelming and limiting. It is tough to find the correct answer if you do not even know what you are looking for. The barrier to entry is much higher than when I built my first plugin in 2007. The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/block-tutorial/writing-your-first-block-type/\">Block Type API</a> makes some things stupidly simple but complicates others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Successfully inserting my first block type into the editor canvas was gratifying. I don&rsquo;t think that feeling ever goes away as a developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Successful insertion and rendering of my first block plugin.\n\n\n\n<p>I am excited about the potential for blocks, such as a breadcrumbs list, when the site editor launches. Many similar features do not make sense in the post editor. However, when users can make direct edits to their templates, it will open a world of possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Learning Curve</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I know enough JavaScript to be a danger to myself and others. Having spent almost the entirety of my professional career in the WordPress realm has meant focusing on PHP. But, programming is programming. Once you have a strong understanding of one language, it not an impossible leap to piddle around enough to create a functional script in another. Most of the same foundational concepts are there. The hurdle is often with learning some new syntax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the biggest obstacle with &ldquo;modern&rdquo; JavaScript is setting up the build tools, bundlers, and more. It can be a tall order to even type out that first line of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, some of the documentation has vanilla JavaScript examples, but when you get into anything more complex than the basics, it is not so vanilla anymore. You will need a way to bundle JavaScript and transform JSX syntax. That means tools like webpack and Babel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/javascript/js-build-setup/\">WordPress has its own script</a> for cutting through most of the complexity, but I recommend <a href=\"https://laravel-mix.com/\">Laravel Mix</a>. It is simple enough for even the least-savvy JavaScript programmers among us and has thorough documentation. It is a script made for folks who want to worry less about tooling and more about actually writing code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block building is also a different kind of leap. Whether it was custom template tags, shortcodes, widgets, or hooks, traditional WordPress development has meant building those in a PHP environment.  I suspect that most plugin developers have tons of features that they can bring to the masses via the block editor. They will often rely on server-side rendering. WordPress has a <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-server-side-render/\"><code>ServerSideRender</code> componen</a>t for actually handling this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the handiest features of registering block types is the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-supports/\">block &ldquo;supports&rdquo; system</a>. <em>Want a background color option?</em> Just one line of code will do. <em>Want the user to access the font-size control?</em> That is a single line too. With little effort, I extended my breadcrumbs block to include a ton of styling options for users. And, they adapt to the site&rsquo;s active theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Testing various combination of block-supported styling options.\n\n\n\n<p>The list of block-supported features offers an array of standardized options at pretty much no development cost. Even the Customize API, previously the most advanced tool for building form fields, did not come this close.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/block-tutorial/block-controls-toolbar-and-sidebar/\">Building custom inspector controls</a> was straightforward once I got the hang of how the block edit piece of the puzzle worked. For now, I have a simple toggle option for enabling/disabling a feature. Often, the hardest part is just finding what you are looking for. WordPress has a massive library of <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/components/\">components</a> to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, I have a basic block on the client (editor) side. Most of the complexity is handled on the server via PHP. If I could build this in an afternoon while attending to nervous cats, it should not be a stretch for more plugin authors to hop aboard this train. There are thousands of shortcodes and widgets that developers can convert to blocks with minimal code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not ready to release my breadcrumbs block into the wild just yet. There is still some fine-tuning left to do and a few advanced features to implement. Also, a breadcrumbs list is primarily needed in a site editor context where users can drop it into something like their header template. We are not there yet, but I will undoubtedly share the final result with the community when we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, I will try to build a block that does not rely on server-side rendering. I think I have the hang of it now. Breaking through that initial barrier is always the hardest step.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Jul 2021 00:28:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 12: WordPress – In Person!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=10889\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/episode-12-wordpress-in-person/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13116:\"<p>In this episode, Josepha Haden Chomphosy talks about WordPress &#8211; In Person!

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we&#8217;re talking about one of my favorite parts of the project &#8211; WordPress events. The in-person component of the project is the dark matter that helps us build resilience and thrive as a group. A lot of what I&#8217;m going to share applies to every WordPress event, whether it&#8217;s a meetup or workshop, a contributor day, any other sort of format. But I&#8217;ll be focused on WordCamps. It&#8217;s been a while since we had any in-person WordCamps. Our last two were WordCamp Malaga in Spain and WordCamp Greenville in the US. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped anyone from gathering people together online. Which honestly makes a lot of sense for WordPress. Because there are many reasons we gather, the main three reasons are connecting, inspiring, and contributing. It&#8217;s true. It says so right in our documentation, &#8220;paper rustling.&#8221; All WordPress events should connect WordPress users, inspire people to do more with WordPress, and contribute to the WordPress project. As an aside, I&#8217;ll tell you that some groups also get to collaborate and educate in there, but connect, inspire, contribute. Those are the big three. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about today. And if you subscribe to this podcast for the back office deep cuts, I&#8217;ll also have a few of those for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so first up, connect. WordCamps are generally annual-ish gatherings organized by local WordPress meetup groups. They&#8217;re not meant to be big or fancy. The definition of the minimum viable product for WordCamp is 50 people gathered all day to talk about WordPress. They are intentionally affordable to allow people from all walks of life to attend, meet, share and learn. This is made possible by donations and sponsorships from local businesses and larger businesses in the WordPress ecosystem. And this helps us get people connected to those in their community that works with or are sustained by WordPress. That connection feeds into the overall health of the global WordPress project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is inspire. WordCamps do not discriminate. They are open to any WordPress users, developers, designers, or other enthusiasts, regardless of their level of experience. And because of this, sessions generally span a variety of formats. So presentations or live demos to workshops or panels, any other format you can think of. But that also means that there are a variety of skill levels represented. There&#8217;s always content about how to use WordPress. That’s a given. But you can also count on content that inspires people to do more with their own dreams and aspirations. When I was still organizing WordCamps, my favorite thing was seeing people who came back year after year, putting into practice something that they learned the year before. It is that <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> aspect to WordCamps that lets people see the edge of their ideas and then expand that just a little bit further. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, contribute. WordCamps often have a contribution component to them. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a talk telling you how you can get more involved in the WordPress project. But sometimes, it&#8217;s a whole contributor day. And those range in size from single focus, like everyone, will show up and learn how to review a theme or a focus from every team that we have, like at the big flagship events where we gather hundreds of people into a room just to contribute to WordPress and all of the teams that go with it. Getting started with contributing can be daunting, but it is also essential to avoid something called the Tragedy of the Commons, an economic concept. So I&#8217;ll share a link to that in the show notes below. But the most important thing, the most important thing to remember, is that WordPress is open source. And we asked people to help us keep this great tool running by giving back a little bit of their time if they have gotten any benefit from the WordPress project or CMS over the course of their careers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s it. The three big things you can get from a WordCamp. I know that I can&#8217;t wait to get back to them myself because while a lot of these things can still happen online and do, it&#8217;s really hard to replace the dark matter of in-person connections for open source projects. And since we&#8217;re talking dark matter anyway, let&#8217;s dig into it a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the start of the section, I mentioned that WordCamps are local, locally organized, and people are encouraged to attend locally. But I am part of a group that ends up traveling to a lot of WordCamps. If you don&#8217;t know about the unseen work of WordPress, this raises eyebrows. So here is some clarification around the back office work that some of these traveling WordCampers often do. When I listed these out, there were about 20 different tasks, 20 different jobs, which was, frankly, a bit overwhelming when I listed them that way. So I&#8217;ve grouped them into kind of two genres, each with a group of current versus future types of work. So my two big buckets, big picture stuff, and then community stewardship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big picture stuff, our first big genre here, when you&#8217;re looking at current topics, current issues kind of information, when we&#8217;re working on big picture stuff, you get the clarification of the mission or vision of WordPress, the sharing of open source methods or processes that we use in the WordPress project, and also sometimes those goal-setting conversations that you have to have both because we have a bunch of teams and team reps, that have a lot of really great ideas about what can be done in their teams to help WordPress succeed. But then also, because when you are working, when you&#8217;re contributing to a single team in the project, it can sometimes be hard to know how your work relates to the overall goals and visions of WordPress. And so that&#8217;s part of the work that gets done that I do there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you&#8217;re looking at future topics, future issues, the second part of this genre, that stuff like starting conversations or discussions around what the future holds for WordPress, and that&#8217;s the project as well as the technology or hearing from people about big things coming up for them. And any content that can support it, anything that I can provide to support those big things. It&#8217;s also a good time for me and others to identify trends based on what I see in presentations or what I hear from people at social functions. Really, it&#8217;s just a huge opportunity for information gathering to make sure that I know what everyone else in the project is trying to do and if they understand what the project is trying to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second big genre of things that happen in that dark matter kind of work at WordCamps is what I call community stewardship—so taking care of the community itself for the project itself. And a lot of that work is actually incident response kind of work. So conflict resolution, mediation often happens at in-person events, but also uncovering the shared foundations, the shared understanding for upcoming changes. So a lot of really, in the weeds kind of change management work. And for me, it&#8217;s certainly doing my best as a cultural liaison when I do see that there has been some miscommunication or gathering context for the latest disagreement that people are having with me so that I can clarify anything that was misunderstood from what I said. And also a little bit of policy clarification, just explaining why we do things and the way we do them. So for community stewardship, that&#8217;s kind of the current stuff that we look at. And that I do when I&#8217;m traveling for WordCamps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for the future tasks that we do with community stewardship in the project, that stuff like training, and that&#8217;s training team reps, community deputies, or new contributors like it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not really one type of training, necessarily. But then also, all of the checking in with our organizers, team reps, volunteers, sponsors, everyone like that, to make sure that what we have in the project and what&#8217;s happening in the project, the tools that we have, the experience that contributors have while they are working here, and WordPress is good, and is what they need. We&#8217;ve got a lot of tools to get things done in WordPress, and we can always make them better. And so checking in with people to kind of see how those processes are, how the tools are making sure that I have an idea of where our holes are and what needs to be patched, and how we can patch them in the long run. So that&#8217;s all of the future planning kind of work and topic stuff, just you know, making sure that WordPress has what it needs to survive long into the future and long after I&#8217;m doing anything with it, and long after you&#8217;re doing anything with it either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, lots and lots of unseen work being done at our in-person events. But folks who keep a keen eye on the online global work of WordPress will probably recognize that a lot of that work is also done routinely on make.wordpress.org and within the making WordPress Slack. There’s just, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s just something different about receiving information from a human being with a face rather than an avatar with a photo. So I guess at the end of the day, that means the dark matter that keeps open source together is really an issue of communication. And you&#8217;ll get no arguments for me there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. And there&#8217;s really just one big thing. And that&#8217;s WordPress 5.8. We are about two weeks away from this big release; the community has been working tirelessly on it. And it&#8217;s shaping up to be one of the most tested releases that we&#8217;ve had in a long time. Myself, I&#8217;m grateful to see so much activity before the release. Since 5.8 and 5.9 releases represent such monumental shifts in our software, I&#8217;m incredibly grateful to see so much activity prior to the release, especially in the beta period. We&#8217;ve been testing everything for it feels like six or eight months, and we&#8217;re really starting to see the positive benefits of that. And I think that we, the WordPress community, should be really proud of everything that we&#8217;re going to ship in 2021. Okay, so that was less of a small list of big things and really like one big thing with a generous garnish of encouragement, but you deserve it. So thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 05 Jul 2021 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"Gutenberg Times: Block-Based Widget Screen and DevNotes Galore for WordPress 5.8 – Weekend Edition #176\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=18404\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/block-based-widget-screen-weekend-edition-176/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19897:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>July is the month celebrating North American Independence (for white people) and the start of the French Revolution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy 154th Birthday, Canada 🇨🇦  (July 1st). <br />Happy 245th Birthday, USA 🇺🇸 (July 4th) <br />Happy 232nd Bastille Day, France 🇫🇷  (July 14th) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many more countries celebrating Independence Day in July, though. <a href=\"https://www.infoplease.com/culture-entertainment/holidays/national-holidays-around-world\">Here is the list.

While the WPAdmin Widget screen feels like a good block editor, he wrote about the block widgets in the Customizer: &#8220;Customizer support for block widgets is light years ahead of where it was just a few short months ago. However, it feels awkward at best. There is a deep feeling of not belonging.

The company raised money from all the investors in this round via a SAFE note, which founder and CEO Craig Hewitt said is a fairly standard investment vehicle for companies at Castos&rsquo; stage of growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;On both the individual and corporate investor side I think the investors see the vision that we have for what the Private Podcasting market can mean for Castos and want to help us achieve that potential,&rdquo; Hewitt said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Private Podcasting is a growing trend where creators and organizations broadcast to supporters in a more intimate format that isn&rsquo;t open to the public. Hewitt likens them to membership sites, except in audio format. It is often used by people who are running membership sites, courses, or online communities as a way to stay connected with members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The other application is companies wanting a way to connect with their employees in audio format,&rdquo; Hewitt said. &ldquo;Podcasting is perfect for that because it&rsquo;s mobile-first, on-demand, and can be consumed asynchronously.&nbsp; We call it the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://castos.com/step-away-experience/\" target=\"_blank\">Step Away Experience</a>.&nbsp;Companies that are adopting Private Podcasting internally are giving their team members a way to consume their internal content without being tied to their computer on a Zoom call or glued to Slack.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Castos is developing a mobile app specifically targeted at the private podcasting market. Hewitt&rsquo;s team is aiming to have the app become a place where people can listen to all of the private podcasts for which they have a subscription. Listeners would simply use the app instead of going through the process of manually subscribing to all their private podcasts via RSS feed. New episodes will appear automatically in the app for subscribers.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;For our corporate clients, the ability to white label our app with their own branding/style is a big win,&rdquo; Hewitt said.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also a much more secure way to distribute private podcast content.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no RSS feed to share around, no files to download (our app is streaming only to offer more security to those files).&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pandemic <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcasting-during-the-pandemic-castos-sees-300-growth-in-new-podcasters\">ramped up unprecedented interest in podcasting</a> when lockdowns were in place across the globe. Even with vaccines more readily available now, Hewitt said Castos is still witnessing strong growth in the podcasting industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There are all the new podcasters in the market now since so many launched podcasts during the pandemic, but now that people are traveling again and commuting to work we&rsquo;re seeing listenership going up quite a bit,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is a trend we expect to continue into the future.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past 10 months, Castos has grown to serve nearly 3,500 customers and the team has grown from seven employees to 13. The company&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/seriously-simple-podcasting/\">Seriously Simple Podcasting</a> plugin is used on more than 30,000 WordPress sites. Castos is actively <a href=\"http://castos.com/careers\">hiring for several roles</a> right now, thanks to the new round of fundraising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;All of the funds will go towards growing our team,&rdquo; Hewitt said. &ldquo;This will be pretty evenly split between product (designers and developers) and Sales and Marketing roles &ndash; more people, more energy, more great minds working on ways that we can better serve our customers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 03 Jul 2021 02:18:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: WordPress Biratnagar Announces Plans for Ujwal Thapa Memorial Scholarship\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119267\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:211:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-biratnagar-announces-plans-for-ujwal-thapa-memorial-scholarship?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-biratnagar-announces-plans-for-ujwal-thapa-memorial-scholarship\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3468:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Earlier this week, the WordPress Biratnagar Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wordpressbrt/posts/1170172963498116\">announced a WordCamp scholarship</a> in honor of Ujwal Thapa. The goal is to honor the legacy left behind by one of Nepal&rsquo;s leaders both inside and outside of the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thapa <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ujwal-thapa-co-founder-of-the-wordpress-nepal-community-passes-away\">passed away a month ago</a> at age 44 from complications with COVID-19. He was a political activist, founding the Bibeksheel Nepali party, originally a peaceful movement against corruption and social injustice. He was the co-founder of WordPress Nepal, a group that has grown to 8,000 members. He was also a close friend and mentor to many in the community and helped many more launch careers in the IT industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;After the untimely death of WordPress contributor and co-founder of WordPress Nepal Ujwal Thapa in 2021, due to COVID-19, the WordPress Biratnagar community decided on this scholarship,&rdquo; wrote the WordPress Biratnagar team. &ldquo;Ujwal was a dedicated patron to the WordPress community in Nepal, and the WordPress Biratnagar decided to pay applause to his memory in this way.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scholarship will cover the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Travel to Biratnagar from within Nepal.</li><li>Hotel stay for the duration of the event.</li><li>A ticket to <a href=\"https://biratnagar.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Biratnagar</a>.</li><li>Local transportation.</li><li>Meals outside the official event.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal is still struggling with getting COVID-19 cases under control at the moment. The CDC <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/covid-4/coronavirus-nepal\">lists the country</a> as &ldquo;very high&rdquo; risk and recommends avoiding travel. There is no date set for a physical conference, and a WordCamp Biratnagar 2021 event is unlikely. The organizing team may not be able to grant a scholarship until next year at the earliest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Biratnagar lead organizer Ganga Kafle said they are just waiting for the situation to return to normal but cannot be sure when that will happen. While there is no date for the next WordCamp, they are still holding regular meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group is still discussing the details of the scholarship. Currently, they plan to consult with other community groups within Nepal and the global community. Any help creating and maintaining such a scholarship system would be welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress Biratnagar team did agree to some guidelines. Once submissions open, applicants must be Nepalese. &ldquo;We believe that empowering community members is an excellent way to honor his memory and carry on his legacy,&rdquo; wrote the team in its announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group leaders mostly agreed to award the scholarship to those meeting the following criteria:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People with disabilities.</li><li>People from lower-income families.</li><li>Women interested in WordPress.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The group said the selection process would be completely transparent, and the awarded scholarship would be at the discretion of the current WordCamp Biratnagar organizers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kafle said the scholarship would also be annual. The team plans to keep this going in honor of Thapa and paying respect to the man who helped jump-start many of their careers and involvement with WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 23:25:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress: June 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10896\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11387:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Once you step into contribution time, your main concern is the users of WordPress, or new contributors, or the health of the WordPress ecosystem as a whole or the WordPress project.

The checklist is still applicable to all meetup groups but in places where vaccines are freely available, meetup organizers can now forego its requirements if they limit gatherings to those self-reporting as fully vaccinated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Andrea Middleton <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-team-discusses-adding-vaccination-status-to-in-person-meetup-safety-checklist\">proposed adding vaccination status</a> to the checklist in mid-May, the idea was met with a wide range of concerns and strong opinions. WordPress&rsquo; global community has experienced the pandemic in different ways, living under a spectrum of local restrictions, with disparate access to vaccines and varying responses to available vaccines. Some participants in the discussions were concerned about organizers having to request information about vaccination status from attendees, which is illegal in many places. Middleton clarified that attendance would be based on the honor system, and organizers would not be requesting any health information from individuals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The WordPress community team is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;expecting or requiring local organizers to organize in-person events for fully-vaccinated people &mdash; we&rsquo;re simply removing the barrier to doing so,&rdquo; she said. The decision <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/07/01/in-person-meetup-events-for-vaccinated-community-members/\">announcement</a> includes a flow chart for the conditions that are now in place:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Middleton characterized the proposal as contentious and something that may be an unpopular decision. Participants in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/05/12/proposal-adding-vaccination-status-to-the-in-person-meetup-safety-checklist/\">discussion</a> got heated in expressing their opinions, which varied greatly based on each person&rsquo;s unique pandemic experiences and convictions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some think it overstepping to prohibit unvaccinated people from attending meetups, others think only allowing vaccinated attendees would create a &ldquo;two-tiered&rdquo; meetup program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This proposal means that multiple groups of people will no longer be allowed to attend our meetings,&rdquo; Taco Verdonschot commented. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re limited to the meetings that are streamed online. They&rsquo;re basically second class citizens in our community now. They can&rsquo;t join the party, they have to watch through the window. Just this idea makes me extremely uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Verdonschot cited several examples of people who might be excluded by the proposal to restart meetups for vaccinated attendees:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People with a low income in areas where the vaccines aren&rsquo;t provided for free</li><li>Younger people in countries where vaccinations are administered to the elderly first, and only slowly make their way to the younger generations (like The Netherlands)</li><li>People who cannot get a vaccination for medical reasons, for example, because of known allergic reactions to vaccinations</li><li>Pregnant women</li><li>People with a limited immune system</li><li>People whose religion doesn&rsquo;t allow them to get vaccinated</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I realize there are some on the team who do not agree, and I hope that these guidelines are flexible enough that you are able to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit\">disagree and commit</a>&nbsp;in this case,&rdquo; Middleton said in the decision announcement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;While I agree that it&rsquo;s only a matter of time when fully-vaxxed-only meetups are a thing of the past, I do think it&rsquo;s important to make that possible for our communities.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 02:52:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Automattic Releases Sketch Block for Drawing in the WordPress Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119486\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:201:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-releases-sketch-block-for-drawing-in-the-wordpress-editor?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=automattic-releases-sketch-block-for-drawing-in-the-wordpress-editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3872:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Automattic released a new plugin titled <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sketch/\">Sketch Block</a> earlier today. It is a one-off block that allows end-users to draw directly in the editor. The plugin is marked as a beta release and requires Gutenberg to be activated to use. It is a part of the company&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/block-experiments/tree/master/blocks/sketch\">Block Experiments project</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be perfectly honest, I spent an excessive amount of time playing around with this block plugin today. And, if I am going overboard with that honesty, most of that time was just trying to write out my name. It was hard not to. Drawing things directly in the editor is just kind of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>Attempts to write my name with Sketch Block.\n\n\n\n<p>I am unsure how many practical uses the plugin actually has at its current stage, but not everything needs a purpose outside of pure entertainment. Like an embedded <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-a-saurus-embeds-a-side-scrolling-t-rex-game-via-the-block-editor\">Block-a-saurus game</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wacky-world-of-sorta-brilliants-sorta-fun-block-plugins\">ghost-written headings</a>, sometimes we just need reminders about the wild and whacky side of the web. We also need to experiment with new ideas from time to time, which can lead to unexpected discoveries, creating the foundation of future technological advancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes we just need to relieve some stress and sketch out our names in a new tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested the block using my laptop&rsquo;s trackpad &mdash; not an ideal method for freehand drawing. Unfortunately, I did not have access to a larger touchscreen device for a more thorough test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block offers a limited number of controls as of version 1.0.7. Users can select between three different stroke widths and choose from their theme&rsquo;s color palette. The block&rsquo;s height can be resized, but there seems to be a minimum of 200px.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did manage to break it a few times, running into the &ldquo;This block has encountered an error and cannot be previewed&rdquo; error. There also seemed to be an unknown minimum width, which could not be adjusted. My goal was to create a columnized team page with each member&rsquo;s signature beneath their profile photo. However, the Sketch block kept breaking outside of my columns. In the end, I created a single-member bio section:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating a profile card with Sketch Block\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is built on top of the <a href=\"https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-freehand\">Perfect Freehand</a> JavaScript library. When comparing Automattic&rsquo;s block implementation to the <a href=\"https://perfect-freehand-example.vercel.app/\">library&rsquo;s demo</a>, the plugin falls short of offering the same experience in block form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect Freehand&rsquo;s demo felt smoother. I was able to consistently draw with more accuracy using my laptop&rsquo;s trackpad. I do not know if just the size of the drawing area made a difference or if the editor interfered with the feeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Drawing in the Perfect Freehand demo.\n\n\n\n<p>The JavaScript library has a ton of extra options too. Users can transform even the worst drawing into something a bit cleaner with the thinning, smoothing, streamline, and other controls. I would love to see the Sketch Block plugin integrate the full suite of tools available through Perfect Freehand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a few bumps, the plugin is a solid first release for a beta project. I am eagerly waiting for what future versions have in store. I also wonder what applications it might have outside of piddling around for fun, such as notetaking or animations.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 01:50:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WPTavern: Gatsby WP Themes Launches New Marketplace\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=116788\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:147:\"https://wptavern.com/gatsby-wp-themes-launches-new-marketplace?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gatsby-wp-themes-launches-new-marketplace\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2861:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://gatsbywpthemes.com/\">Gatsby WP Themes</a> project has launched a new marketplace for developers who are building WordPress-powered sites with Gatsby on the frontend. Originally founded by Zac Gordon and Alexandra Spalato, the commercial venture is now primarily managed by Spalato and Paulina Hetman. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team&rsquo;s first project involved <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gatsby-wordpress-themes-project-partners-with-theme-shops-to-port-popular-themes-to-gatsby\">porting the Twenty Twenty WordPress Theme</a> to a Gatsby WP Theme. They are now focused on creating commercial themes targeted at developers and agencies who can use them to save time when building clients&rsquo; sites. Gatsby is more well-suited to sites that don&rsquo;t have a lot of dynamic content, such as marketing or documentation sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gatsby WP Themes is launching with several starter themes with different styles for each child theme. They include designs suitable for blogs, personal sites, businesses, restaurants, and portfolios.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Gatsby themes have several distinct advantages over just grabbing a starter or boilerplate Gatsby site from GitHub. Spaloto identified a few reasons why developers might opt for using a theme:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Gatsby themes allow Gatsby site functionality to be packaged as a standalone product for reuse.</li><li>All of your default configuration lives in an npm package.</li><li>Themes are versioned packages that can be updated like any other package.</li><li>If you created multiple sites using the same theme, you can just update the central theme to push changes across all of them.</li><li>Themes are composable: You can install a blog theme alongside a notes theme, alongside an e-commerce theme (and so forth).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All themes in the new Gatsby WP Themes marketplace include built-in support for dynamic comments, search, Mailchimp integration, sitemaps, Google analytics or Google Tag Manager, and various widgets. The marketplace also includes Gatsby plugins that make popular WordPress plugins more compatible with Gatsby frontends.

It has been a slow process as I have patiently waited for the feature to mature into a powerful tool for end-users. I am still as much a believer now as I was then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is betting big on patterns too. The feature is now a top-level <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33094\">site-editing component</a> with several sub-features under development. As Gutenberg project lead Matias Ventura noted, &ldquo;From directory browsing to placeholder setup to transformations, patterns are crucial component of the entire site editing scope.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year ago, patterns were just an idea, almost a footnote compared to other upcoming features. Since WordPress 5.5 included the Patterns API for developers, over 100 themes in the official directory bundle them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new pattern directory is launching on WordPress.org next month alongside the version 5.8 release. There are already over 30 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">community-contributed patterns</a> approved. More are likely to land in the coming weeks. The directory will also eventually be open to anyone who wants to submit new designs. Any WordPress user will have the choice to select from this collection directly from their WordPress admin interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These ideas are just scratching the surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, the block patterns feature is a simple way of bundling one or more blocks into a preconfigured design. Users can point and click to insert them into their post or page content. The goal of the block system is not just to be a page builder where users must create everything from scratch. While we want it to be flexible enough to do that, most users should have the ability to simply insert sections of a design and customize them. This could be as simple as an audio player with a background to a portfolio layout that showcases their latest projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, the user experience is only set up to handle a dozen or patterns at a time &mdash; too many choices can be a less-than-ideal adventure. As the library grows, the interface will need to evolve with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>How can we build experiences on top of this foundation that mitigates some of the complexity?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gutenberg development team is already working on multiple solutions, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/28736\">contextual suggestions</a> for a selected block. However, one of the more promising features is patterns registered for specific block types. In this case, template parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a user wants to select a new pattern for the header of their website, they should not have to sort through every option to find something. With Header patterns, the editor presents the user with a carousel of choices to scroll through specific to that template part.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>Scrolling through header patterns.\n\n\n\n<p>This same feature is possible with footers too:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting a footer pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>Those who have been beta testing WordPress 5.8 or running the Gutenberg plugin in the last few months may have noticed some similarities to the Query Loop block (formerly named Query). It is the same underlying system that allows developers to attach patterns to a specific block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can already select from multiple Query Loop patterns when first inserting the block:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting a Query Loop pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Recent improvements to the Template Part and Query Loop blocks has opened up a whole new world for how patterns can be used,&rdquo; wrote Kjell Reigstad in a recent <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2021/06/25/theme-patterns-for-the-site-editor/\">ThemeShaper blog post</a>. &ldquo;Both blocks can now display a carousel of block patterns in their setup state, allowing users to choose between a menu of pre-designed versions of these blocks. These patterns can be bundled with your theme, so that users have a wide range of pre-designed header, query, and footer options available to choose from in the Site Editor.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reigstad has an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/31610\">open ticket</a> for several core header and footer patterns. The following is a short video clip of how this works:</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>As any theme developer knows, you cannot simply plop anything into the header and make it look good. It is one of the most specialized areas of theme design. One wrong turn and the entire design falls apart. The downside to this feature will be third-party patterns coming from the directory. Some will work. Others will not fit into every theme design, but they are not necessarily meant to. It could be a support nightmare for theme authors or an opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme developers will be able to steer their own ship, offering a range of choices that are perfectly molded to their designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I can already see it&hellip;multipurpose themes with 50+ header patterns listed in their marketing material.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is unlikely that many people had this in mind during the conceptual stages of block patterns, they are evolving. They will be more than just something users can stick into their post content at random. They are that semi-controlled experience that will give users the flexibility of choice, but the theme serves as a guide for making intelligent decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a theme author offers four or five well-designed Header or Footer template patterns, users are more likely to select from those. It is easier than building from the ground up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a system also opens more <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-system-will-create-more-commercial-opportunities-for-wordpress-theme-authors\">commercial opportunities</a>. Imagine upselling specialized pattern collections for niches. A restaurant site header might want to focus on an &ldquo;order online&rdquo; button. A news website could feature a &ldquo;latest stories&rdquo; ticker above the site title and navigation. There are endless ideas, all awaiting a savvy theme developer to implement and monetize them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, I am eager to see where patterns go. They are still the most exciting WordPress feature, offering the API that theme authors have needed for the past decade.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 02:06:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WPTavern: WP Engine Makes Local Pro Free for All Users\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119329\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:153:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-makes-local-pro-free-for-all-users?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wp-engine-makes-local-pro-free-for-all-users\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3025:\"<p>WP Engine <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/blog/wp-engine-supercharges-wordpress-development-local-pro-free-for-everyone/?utm_medium=organicsocial&utm_source=twitter\">announced</a> today that Local Pro, the commercial upgrade for its local WordPress development product, is now free for all users.

Shortly after, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/markdown-comment-block/\">Markdown Comment Block</a> plugin appeared on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is a one-off block. It allows users to enter notes directly into the post editor that will not appear on the front end of the site. Tabor said he came up with the idea when working on an article for building single-block plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are few things I love more than simple plugins with a tight focus, performing a single function. Markdown Comment Block lands in this category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin creates a new block that works nearly the same as a typical Paragraph block:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding inline comments to a post.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can change the text color, but they will not have access to the typical Rich Text controls. Those should be unnecessary anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who does long-form writing almost exclusively in Markdown, the block&rsquo;s use of the double percent-sign syntax for comments intrigued me. Technically, the Markdown spec does not support any sort of special characters for them. It handles HTML comments. However, those appear in the source code on the front end when the document is rendered. I have only seen the <code>%%</code> mark to denote comments in the <a href=\"https://www.inspire-writer.com/\">Inspire Writer</a> app for Windows. Tabor said he had seen the same in <a href=\"https://ulysses.app/\">Ulysses</a>. The feature also exists in the <a href=\"https://useiceberg.com/\">Iceberg editor</a> for WordPress, which Tabor created alongside Jeffrey Carandang.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin also introduces the <code>%%</code> keyboard shortcut. Typing it directly in the editor will create a new Markdown Comment block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My primary use case for the plugin would be leaving notes for my later self. However, it could also be handy in users&rsquo; publishing flows. The block adds a &ldquo;Resolve&rdquo; button to the toolbar. Clicking it deletes the comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Clicking the &ldquo;Resolve&rdquo; button will delete the block.\n\n\n\n<p>The block itself will not likely offer a robust enough feature set for complex workflows. However, pairing it with a plugin like <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/upgrade-your-publishing-flow-with-the-post-descriptions-wordpress-plugin\">Post Descriptions</a> could round out the experience for larger teams of writers and copyeditors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Post Descriptions plugin allows users to add notes on the post level. These notes appear on the post-management screen, letting other team members know when to check an article. However, it may be hard to provide the full context of what issues need to be resolved before publishing. Markdown Comment Block adds an inline comments system, letting team members pass in-text notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme developers should appreciate that the block uses CSS custom properties too, which makes it easy to overwrite its default style rules.  In moments, I was able to make it match my theme:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom color, font, and line-height styles.\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>--markdown-comment-font-size</code>, <code>--markdown-comment-line-height</code>, and <code>--markdown-comment-color</code> variables are available for theme developers who want to add in support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one complaint I had about the block is its title: &ldquo;Comment.&rdquo; It is easy to confuse it with the six other comment-related blocks already in the WordPress block list. And, there will only be more in upcoming versions. Giving it a title of &ldquo;Markdown Comment&rdquo; would better distinguish it from others.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 00:15:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"WPTavern: BuddyPress 9.0 Scheduled for Short Development Cycle to Ship Block-Based Widgets Ahead of WordPress 5.8\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119255\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:271:\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-9-0-scheduled-for-short-development-cycle-to-ship-block-based-widgets-ahead-of-wordpress-5-8?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=buddypress-9-0-scheduled-for-short-development-cycle-to-ship-block-based-widgets-ahead-of-wordpress-5-8\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3801:\"<p><a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2021/06/buddypress-8-0-0-alfano/\">BuddyPress 8.0</a> was just released earlier this month on June 6, but the core development team is gearing up for a <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2021/06/24/bp-dev-chat-summary-june-23-2021/\">short development cycle for 9.0</a>. The release will be specifically targeted at getting BuddyPress core widgets ready for WordPress 5.8&rsquo;s new block widgets experience. Contributors are aiming to hit the following timeline to ship 9.0 before the next major WordPress release:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Beta: July 8.</li><li>RC: July 12.</li><li>Final:&nbsp;<strong>July 16</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>BuddyPress entered the world of blocks with the release of version 6.0 in May 2020, allowing users to insert a specific Member or Group into content. Version 7.0, released six months later, introduced blocks for featuring a list of members, a list of groups, and the ability to embed a public activity post. Over the next few weeks, BuddyPress contributors will continue the process of <a href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/bp-blocks/issues/37\">migrating the rest of the BuddyPress component widgets to blocks</a>. These include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Blogs Recent Posts Widget</strong>: A list of recently published posts from across the network</li><li><strong>BP Core Login Widget</strong>: Shows a Log In form to logged-out visitors, and a Log Out link to those who are logged in</li><li><strong>BP Core Friends Widget</strong>: A dynamic list of recently active, popular, and newest Friends of the displayed member. Widget is only shown when viewing a member profile</li><li><strong>BP Groups Widget</strong>: A dynamic list of recently active, popular, newest, or alphabetical groups</li><li><strong>BP Core Members Widget</strong>: A dynamic list of recently active, popular, and newest members</li><li><strong>BP Core Recently Active Widget</strong>: Profile photos of recently active members</li><li><strong>BP Core Who&rsquo;s Online Widget</strong>: Profile photos of online users</li><li><strong>BP Messages Sitewide Notices Widget</strong>: Display Sitewide Notices posted by the site administrator</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BP Nouveau widgets:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>BP Latest Activities</strong>: Display the latest updates of your community having the types of your choice</li><li><strong>BP Nouveau Navigation Widget</strong>: Displays BuddyPress primary nav in the sidebar of the site. (Must be used as the first widget of the sidebar and only once.)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to building a block for every BuddyPress widget, contributors are aiming to make it possible to <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8496\">transform existing BP widgets into their corresponding BP block</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the new block widgets screen imminently landing in WordPress, BuddyPress has to make this move forward to keep pace with the progress of the block editor&rsquo;s march beyond use in the content editor. Otherwise, BuddyPress users would need to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/classic-widgets-plugin-disables-wordpress-5-8s-upcoming-block-based-widgets-system\">disable block widgets with the Classic Widgets plugin</a> in order to maintain access to BuddyPress core widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors are also working on creating a new Follow component, a frequently requested feature which would use the now abandoned <a href=\"https://github.com/r-a-y/buddypress-followers\">BuddyPress Follow</a> plugin as inspiration. The feature will work similar to Twitter following or the Facebook follow button that allows users to see public activity posts for those they are following. The Follow component is being built as a plugin first and will ship with 9.0 if it is ready in time.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 01:07:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: Diving Into WordPress 5.8’s New Widgets Screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119259\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:155:\"https://wptavern.com/diving-into-wordpress-5-8s-new-widgets-screen?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=diving-into-wordpress-5-8s-new-widgets-screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6657:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">It has been a while since I have touched widgets. Once the site editor landed in the Gutenberg plugin, I almost exclusively dropped the old sidebar paradigm and moved to block templates. Reactivating old themes and jumping into the widgets screen felt like time-traveling into a bygone era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of being deeply embedded within block themes, it is hard to imagine moving back to the sidebar widgets system that most WordPress users are still using today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-beta-1-released-new-blocks-new-widgets-screen-and-pattern-directory-on-deck\">WordPress 5.8 is slated to ship</a> with a small taste of bringing blocks outside of the content editor. However, it can feel like a surface-level refresh of a dying system, one that does not always work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block-based widgets are part of the transitional phase between classic WordPress and the future, which centers on a complete site editor. Once the bulk of themes are built atop blocks, the need for widgets will wane. The site editor and block themes do not support the old sidebar system. Instead, users will be able to place blocks anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last October, I asked the question: <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/are-block-based-widgets-ready-to-land-in-wordpress-5-6\">Are Block-Based Widgets Ready To Land in WordPress 5.6?</a> At the time, the widgets screen was expected to launch with the final release of 2020. However, the development team pulled back on the feature&rsquo;s inclusion, primarily because the customizer implementation was sub-par.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking the same question of WordPress 5.8, my answer is mostly the same. It is time to ship the current feature and prepare for a future without widgets. There are so many components that are far more exciting around the corner. The primary user-experience issues will linger around until users have moved on to block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have long been in the camp of starting from a clean slate for block themes, letting widgets die out. However, the path WordPress has chosen is to create this stepping stone for users who may be on traditional themes for a while. It provides an opportunity to use blocks outside of the editor, which may be a leap forward for many.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the vast number of libraries, one-off blocks, and support from plugin authors, users have a wealth of block choices at their fingertips. Right now, if there is no equivalent widget, those users can only ever use those blocks in their content. Within a block-widget system, that limitation does not exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also lifts some burdens from developers. Those who want to shed some of their old code and go all-in on blocks can begin considering deprecating or retiring widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transitioning to the new Widgets screen should feel simple to users familiar with the WordPress content editor. Inserting blocks is the same. The difference is that each sidebar has its own container.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Widgets screen with a Gallery block in the Footer sidebar.\n\n\n\n<p>The range of blocks within core WordPress could also let users drop some of their widgets-based plugins. One of the most popular types of widgets over the years has been for handling post lists. There are dozens of such plugins and an untold number of themes that include one. Coupled with WordPress 5.8&rsquo;s Query Loop block, users can now recreate many of those widgets themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom post list using the Query Loop block.\n\n\n\n<p>Much of this depends on the theme&rsquo;s design support of blocks and whether it will accommodate anything other than traditional widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customizer support for block widgets is lightyears ahead of where it was just a few short months ago. However, it feels awkward at best. There is a deep feeling of not belonging. While it was a remarkable programming feat to make the two features work together, the user experiences are nearly a decade apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Editing a Heading block in the customizer.\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the customizer providing a live preview, the Widgets screen in the WordPress admin gives the necessary workspace. Trying to squeeze the block editor into the tiny customize controls panel was never going to be an ideal experience, and it still is not. It gets the job done, but I recommend the traditional widgets screen for fewer headaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Problems Remain</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In the eight months since I first dived into the block-based widgets, the system has been overhauled. However, the potential issues I brought up remain. Just dropping blocks into a sidebar can have mixed results. For example, compare a Legacy Widget to Heading and Latest Comments blocks in the footer sidebar of the popular OceanWP theme:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Mismatched headings and colors.\n\n\n\n<p>The issue is that WordPress treats every block as a widget. Traditionally, widgets have had both a title and content. Blocks have no such concept. A Heading followed by something like a Paragraph, Latest Comments, or another block has no special meaning in the block system. They are all treated separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This issue is in full view when adding blocks to the default Twenty Twenty-One WordPress theme:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Block treated as widget in Twenty Twenty-One footer sidebar.\n\n\n\n<p>Notice the Heading and Latest Comments blocks are columnized because they are seen as separate widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To address this, users must add multiple blocks into a Group block if they want them treated as a single &ldquo;widget.&rdquo; It is a simple matter, but it could still be a usability hurdle for some.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with a fix in place, there is no guarantee that blocks will appear as the widgets the theme author intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I long ago gave up on the hope that there would be better handling for block widgets. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/classic-widgets-plugin-disables-wordpress-5-8s-upcoming-block-based-widgets-system\">Classic Widgets plugin</a> is available for those who need it, and <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/widgets/opting-out/#using-remove_theme_support\">theme authors can opt-out</a>. These are necessary tools for an experience that can range from downright awesome to utterly broken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bringing blocks outside of the content editor for traditional theme users is probably necessary for the transition, but the current site editor experience already feels much smoother than block widgets. The long-term focus should be on moving away from the dated concept of widgets and into a WordPress front-end 100% built on blocks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 23:52:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Gutenberg Times: Theme.json Resources, Block Patterns and WordPress 5.8 – Weekend Edition #175\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=18320\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/theme-json-resources-block-patterns-and-wordpress-5-8-weekend-edition-175/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13004:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We enjoy cooling off at the community pool after our lunch walks.

The webinar is now live and welcome to our 28th Gutenberg live Q and A on this June 24th. My name is Birgit Pauli-Haack and I am your host for today&#8217;s discussion. Thank you all for watching, and it&#8217;s great to have you. And while you all come in, use the chat window to tell us where you are and where you&#8217;re watching from.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And today we will discuss a new way to configure themes, that is black themes, with global styles and settings file theme.json. And it will enable theme developers to centralize all the block-based settings, color palettes, font sizes, and other block-based customizations. This way you will also control which of the other block features the theme supports or does not support.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s my simple mind&#8217;s description of the new features and I&#8217;m so thrilled to have three experts on the show to go beyond this simple explanation and help theme developers to get started. I&#8217;m extremely honored to have Daisy Olsen, developer advocate at Automatic and WordPress contributor. Hey, good to have you. Also Jeff Ong, code wrangler at Automatic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong: </em>Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Thanks for being here. And at last but not at least Tammie Lister, design lead at Extendify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> We&#8217;ll do some proper introduction in less than a minute. I just have a few housekeeping notes. So after the introduction, we&#8217;ll have a first round robin question and then we see a demo. Jeff was working really hard on it and I think he was the only one repairing hard for this live Q and A. And then we&#8217;ll discuss the different angles and how they get started. And then, of course, answer your question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of questions, how do you pose your questions? There&#8217;s a Q and A on the bottom of the screen, a kind of icon. You click on that and write your question. And for those watching on YouTube use the chat window next to the video player. And so saying hi. Hi, Victor. From Buenos Aires in Argentina. Awesome. Thank you for being here. All right. When you do comments and questions, so please be kind even if you disagree.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a family endeavor. All right. Well, I&#8217;m thrilled you all agreed dear panelists to come on the show and I get an hour to talk with you about your work. So, Daisy, tell us a little bit about you, where are you&#8217;re located and what is it that you do as developer advocate on the purpose project and at Automatic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>Yeah. I&#8217;m Daisy Olsen and I live in New Hampshire in the United States. It&#8217;s a beautiful day here right now unlike some parts of this country that are really hot. We got the cool weather over here this week. So as a developer advocate, I talk about WordPress a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get out and do workshops, teach classes, write documentation and just stay involved and close to the projects development so that I know what&#8217;s going on theoretically and can share that out particularly with plugin and theme developers as well as agencies and freelancers and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Awesome. So glad you&#8217;re here. Thank you. So, Tammie, thank you for coming back to the show. It&#8217;s been over three years. The last time you were on the show was just after Gutenberg was merged into Core and you were one of the three leads with Matias Ventura and Joen Asmussen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you shared a lot about the journey of Gutenberg and the philosophy behind it. So I will put the link to the show into the show notes for you who have been coming later to Gutenberg. But this year you joined the WordPress product company Extendify. So what do you do there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> First of all, has it been three years? That goodness. Time flies. So in Extendify I focus on design. So our solutions extend the editor. And then the aim is to make it even more usable for people&#8217;s purpose that they want to use it for. And I&#8217;m really, really excited about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it means that people can have the best experience from the content they&#8217;re creating, to the layout, the patterns, the styles, whatever that the editor enables, that&#8217;s really what I&#8217;m focusing on. So it&#8217;s a interesting new challenge to do. And you have blew my brain with that time span. You really have. That&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, it&#8217;s also over three years that Gutenberg times us. So I&#8217;ve been part of that journey so for so long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Congrats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Nothing really held my attention for so long. And normally I get really bored. Well, I&#8217;m also really happy that Extendify took over <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/editorplus/\">Editor Plus</a> from Munir Kumal and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-options/\">EditorsKit</a> from Jeffrey Carandang. So, those have a more sustainable way now to access because both Munir and Jeffrey seem to have&#8230; Munir joined you, but Jeffrey moved on to be a consultant at , I think, 10up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> It&#8217;s so really exciting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I imagine. So thank you also to Jeff Ong for joining us today as well. You&#8217;re a code wrangler in Automatic and what have you been working on lately except for the demo. I know about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong</em>: Well, first, thank you for having me and hosting this. Awesome to be here. I feel very honored to be with three on-time contributors. So super cool. At Automattic, I&#8217;ve been working on theme development, pretty solely focused on that for the last year. And my background is not in WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s kind of been an interesting journey to transition and learn about the ecosystem and really coming at a transitory time figuring out how do we kind of move into this new block-based paradigm? How do we make themes that work with the block editor really well and can hopefully unlock more creativity for just really great design. And I can tell you what sites again. Well, making new themes and figuring out how to do that with the latest version of Gutenberg, which turns out every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So the viewers follow Jeff Ong, he&#8217;s going to teach you how to do things with the Block Editor. And we will soon see a little demo of that. It&#8217;s what Daisy said, &#8220;What you did in five minutes, I taught a course on that in three hours.&#8221; So it&#8217;s going to be a little fast paced today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2-strong-what-will-change-most-for-the-theme-developers-when-building-themes-for-full-site-editing-strong\">What will change most for the theme developers when building themes for full-site editing?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we head into media&#8217;s raised, I would like to ask each of you, so what do you think will change most for the theme developers when building themes? These are for agency building custom themes for the clients or for theme shops rolling out new themes to sell. Do you want to start, Tammie?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Yeah. That&#8217;s interesting because I think perhaps it&#8217;s a change if you wanted to be a change. Because lots of this is an opt-in, as is the way. WordPress, the best way to opt-in. I go back to a lot of times that this is a freeing of things and I think it brings an opportunity that has pros and cons, ups and downs with opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But plug-ins themes no longer have to pretend that they&#8217;re plugins and they no longer have to be everything and have to be things that they weren&#8217;t intended to be in the first. So I think that that is a challenge in itself because there&#8217;s a certain way that you maybe thought you had to do things and now you don&#8217;t have to work around things. We often have to work around things in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t have to work around it, it can feel a little bit peculiar, but once you realize you don&#8217;t have to do that, it&#8217;s actually really awesome. But you have to realize you don&#8217;t have to and that WordPress was getting in the way. I also think as a result there&#8217;s going to be a space for more creativity, and this can also be really to challenging because maybe you were limited to what you could do creativity wise because of just the confinements of the space and the confinements of what you could do before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s going to open things again to a lot more people. And a lot more people who maybe didn&#8217;t have access to a theme developer with experience who knew the exact ins and outs of it. So I think that&#8217;s a challenge because new people in this space, new creativity. But honestly I think it&#8217;s a good thing. It&#8217;s just if you want to and you&#8217;re open to it and you can kind of explore those new ways, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a change that you have to make. I think that&#8217;s the thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Awesome. Thank you. Daisy, what do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>So I think I would agree with Tammie that the barrier of entry for a new theme designer. And I think that&#8217;s one of the key things is it&#8217;s bringing the design back to theming. Theming over time became very functional. We had a lot of theme companies that were trying to make their themes as flexible, powerful and feature-ful as possible to reach a wide variety of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that we can see some opportunity for vertically oriented designs coming out where you have a theme that is geared towards a restaurant or geared towards, I don&#8217;t know, a salon or a certain kind of a business or even a personal site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity to be able to have a lot of variety out there in the marketplace so that when someone asks you inevitable question, because this was probably the most common question when I was working for a thing company is which theme is best for this?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m doing this kind of a site, which themes should I use. And it could make it so, well, here are five that are really geared towards what you&#8217;re trying to do instead of, oh, you can use any of them. You just have to do all this work to get it to look bright.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah. That&#8217;s a good point. Thank you. Jeff?.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Definitely, from a design perspective, it&#8217;s super exciting. I want to highlight maybe a little bit more from the development side. This seems like the biggest opportunity or clearest opportunity to ensure that your theme is integrated with the editor. That the things that you&#8217;re doing with the editor and your ability to customize it to control what presets and options are available there to the users of the theme, this is the theme [inaudible 00:12:27].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a unifying kind of idea and single point of truth. Talking about theme.json and even just this whole concept of how do we bring the experience together. I think we have an opportunity to do that and that&#8217;s going to change even in some small level. Even if your theme.json cloud just as a few settings. You can take it slow like Tammie was saying. Incorporate parts of it because to me you have this new contract now that can really unify things and bring things together from a lot of disparate parts and pieces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Lots to think about. And I agree with all of you. I had this pleasure last year that I took over themes from agencies and they were so powerful and all the things that normally a plug-in will do, custom post types and rigid and all that. It&#8217;s all in one place and we won&#8217;t be able to change a theme at all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now this is definitely going to make life a lot easier for site owners as well So lots to think about and listening to you is quite inspiring to kind of think, oh, well how many direction can my brain go now? But, Jeff, are you ready for your demo? I think it would be helpful for all the people here on the call to see what it&#8217;s all about and how it kind of gets started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Yes. We have 10 minutes roughly. Yes. Can you see my screen? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> We can see your screen. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-demo-configuring-the-block-editor-with-theme-json-file\">Demo: Configuring the block editor with theme.json file</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBwhHKKblhU&t=18s\">14.02</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff Ong: So we have a blank theme here and I just want to kind of go over some, not going to cover everything, but some of the key parts of that theme.json introduces and show how that impacts a blank theme and also the editor. So hopping over to my code editor. I have my theme.JSON here. This is a really basic, simple theme and nothing going on yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In here I&#8217;m going to go ahead and the first thing I want to talk about are the settings of your theme.JSON. Settings are kind of what control or give you the ability to configure the editor and what kind of customization options are present to a user and the theme. The only thing I have right now is the layout, which we&#8217;ll get to in a second. But let&#8217;s say I want to add some color options here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously it would be done in the functions PHP. I have kind of a few sheets over here. Sorry. I need to hide these meeting control. I&#8217;m going to copy a color palette from this. I&#8217;m going to set a palette that&#8217;s going to become available to me in my theme. I go to edit the same post. In here I see my cornso, my orange, red, and color blue that&#8217;s become available to me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s pretty interesting about this is before you would have had to kind of go into functions at this whole palette and then also define the class name, something like this to actually apply those styles. Let&#8217;s say I want this heading to be orange, update it. Show it here. I get all this cool stuff for free. This class was generated for me by Gutenberg using this preset and that I have defined meeting controls defined here in my palette options.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another cool thing or interesting about the possibility here is within the same configuration. Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m the theme designer. I have the option right now to change the color to kind of anything I want. The powerful thing about theme.json at this time is it can actually turn something like this off. I actually don&#8217;t want people or my users to be able to change anything, change the color palette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let&#8217;s go ahead and reset this back here. Turned off custom colors within theme.json. And then back here you&#8217;ll see that option has disappeared. So inaccessible color combinations or just color combinations that you don&#8217;t want to be available. You can turn that off. This is just one of the options that are available. Color is just one of the options that you can customize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also take a look at something like typography. I think I can find some font sizes here. Refresh. I can see now that those presets were available, are now available to me. I can do the same thing again here too. Say I don&#8217;t actually want people to be able to change all sides here. As a designer I know it&#8217;s best and I don&#8217;t want people putting in random font sizes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So disable that and now only my presets are available too. Oh, by the way, this content is just kind of some standard block-based content. Again, I&#8217;m getting all of this kind of for free or for free in a way by just applying some preset values here. Well, I think the next thing that I wanted to cover is going into the last thing. I&#8217;ll cover it within the settings because you can actually change these per block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember we were looking at color before. I could add a color key to the paragraph block and actually say, just kidding. I want to allow you to be able to change the color of paragraph blocks. Just the paragraph blocks. I can open up the whole thing. So within here now I can see, oh, I can actually change just for paragraph blocks. I go up to my heading. This custom color is not available. This color option is not available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to I could also supply a custom palette. I&#8217;m not going to do that, but could say if you wanted a specific palette that&#8217;s just applied for paragraph blocks. That would be how you do it. So I think that&#8217;s it for settings. I&#8217;m going to go ahead and collapse this now and move on to the styles key of our theme.json. And now within here I can start to define some files.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember our colors from up here from the palette. I can go ahead and because I know that WordPress is generating CSS variables based on these palettes, I can go ahead and start to use those within the styles application of the style section of my theme.json. So with the preset color, put orange red. See what else do. These are going to apply at the top level. So this is going to apply to everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say I only wanted, for instance, my headings to be&#8230; Let&#8217;s make this. Do the same thing in here and say, ah, I just want, actually, let&#8217;s just make my paragraph colors black. So, again, what I&#8217;ve done here is I&#8217;ve set my global kind of text color to this orange red was preset, which was provided by WordPress and generated here to the entire text. And then actually I can go in and target specific block, set the settings for that as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we are close. I just want to show, well, if you&#8217;re editing this, something that&#8217;s also probably going to happen and mess this up. It should throw some kind of an error here yet. Notice there when decoding theme.json. So that&#8217;ll let you know there&#8217;s something going on because it&#8217;s pretty easy tip something up here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s just a small note is we&#8217;ll likely encounter that if you&#8217;re configuring keys and nested objects trying to figure out how each of those apply. You pause here for a second. I guess the last thing I want to cover too is the concept of elements. So within here, any h2 that I have is going to be applied a specific style here. So I have the same because [inaudible 00:24:24] can appear outside of blocks or links, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are restricted to a specific set at the moment. So let&#8217;s just say text. So, again, because this is not actually rendered as a pocket and an element and that can appear anywhere. That&#8217;s something that I can target with this kind of top level elements select here. Everything else here you can target with the name of the block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is most of what I wanted to cover pretty fast, but again all of the settings that you can find here or that I&#8217;m going over, there&#8217;s way more than just color. There&#8217;s spacing, typography and all of that can be found in documentation that Birgit, I think she shared it here. So that I want to open it up. And I guess there are questions. If there are specific parts that anyone would want to go into in a little more detail. Happy to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>Thank you, Jeff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Thank you, Jeff. This was awesome. Do you want to just say something?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>Yeah. I just wanted to say that maybe we could just talk about layout real quick because I think that&#8217;s going to be a big one for 5.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Yeah. And I kind of skipped over. It was the first thing that was in here. Yes. Layout key is a way for you to quickly define the default, the width of your content within WordPress or within here. So if you see here, if I don&#8217;t define this layout, a lot of my content is just going to be full width by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can supply two values here. Content size, it&#8217;s just going to be the default width. You can also define, I think it&#8217;s, what is it? Wide size. Wide width. Nothing happened there because I hadn&#8217;t provided it. Maybe there&#8217;s a better way to show that with cover block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Nice. I like it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Pretty cool. You can, I mean, alignment coming together and within a unified system reliably layout content with starting here is pretty powerful stuff I&#8217;d say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. Awesome. So I shared in the chat window, if you haven&#8217;t seen it, the documentation link where you can read up about the theme.json as a whole. When you say, Daisy, that that&#8217;s the layout will be important for 5.8, which part of it would be, where does it come into play?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> So with 5.8 with the custom template functionality that&#8217;s coming where you can basically create a custom template for an entire page or a post that would cover your header as well as your content. If you need to have these setting set for the width, especially the content size for it but preferably also wide so that your site knows how wide it should be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise you get kind of the facts that Jeff showed where it was the full width of the page. It didn&#8217;t have anything to contain it down to the width that you want. So for any theme that wants to use the template editor would benefit from having a theme.json file that even if it only has the one thing in it, it would be good way to take advantage of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s an excellent tip. Thank you, Daisy. You heard it here first. So we already got some questions in our Q and A, but I just wanted to have one question for Jeff before. That&#8217;s my prerogative as a host, I get the first question. So if I understood it correctly, so until now, theme.json comes into play I had to create many different places or touch many different places to make a color palette work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I had to put it in my functions.php and then I also have to put it in my style sheet. Is [inaudible 00:30:04] that I don&#8217;t have to do this anymore, or do I still have to put it into my style sheet, or is it automatically created with when I put the color palette in the theme.json?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> It is wonderful question. It is automatically created. This is all that that style sheet looks like since this is one of the big very exciting aspects of a theme.json. It&#8217;s that it&#8217;s managing this for you. And then also I think more down the line by providing colors and styles in this way. And then also by applying the styles here you can guarantee that those blocks are going to integrate properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like the styles for those blocks are going to be more closely tied and actually in how the block is implemented. So no more writing styles that are overwriting that we&#8217;re having to target specific nested blocks. And so there&#8217;s tons of complications to this and there&#8217;s a lot more room to mature and develop, but I think that&#8217;s one of the parts I&#8217;m most excited about. To your point, there&#8217;s one place now where I can define my palette and show how it should be applied. I don&#8217;t have to go into two different places to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. Well, let&#8217;s go to the questions. Victor Kane, from the beginning of the show has already put them in and he&#8217;s particular interested in finding out about the workflow using them theme.json. So one is the best editing alternative for VS Code formatting, and then the second one was the possibility for exporting interactive selections to clipboard and code. I&#8217;m not quite sure I understand the question. Maybe you understand it, Jeff Daisy, Tammie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Personally. So I think this is a personal choice. I&#8217;m going to start with an answer and then go to&#8230; I use VS Code, so I may not be able to give the right answer there. I would be curious to know what you don&#8217;t want in VS Code, and I think that that&#8217;s the thing. This opens up personal&#8230; I&#8217;m going to be really bad at reading the response in chat whilst talking. So I&#8217;m going to be a little bit pertinent and kind of speak first. I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;ll get back to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s your personal choice how you write and then you can kind of go back to it. So the thing that I did, this was my workflow, it has been my workflow so far, and I think this is the thing, we&#8217;re all finding our own new workflows with these new toys that we&#8217;re playing with. So what I&#8217;ve been doing is I&#8217;ve been using theme.json.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve actually been setting up variables using SAS that have been then pulling in root variables into my theme.json so that I can pull them through. That&#8217;s a weird way to do it. That&#8217;s strange, but the reason being, it means I can reuse and keep things separately. But I&#8217;m sure that everybody on this call has their own little workflows that they are kind of working from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> My approach to that was actually the opposite that I was using my theme.json to set all of my variables so that I didn&#8217;t need SAS, which I think for those that never quite got their head wrapped around preprocessed CSS, it might be a way to simplify things for those that prefer it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Awesome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister: </em>I think it&#8217;s what you&#8217;re cozy with, right? And I think that&#8217;s the thing. This can adapt to what was your cozy blanket of coding, and you don&#8217;t have to lose that yet, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. So Victor commented on that. If I get the results, I want interactively with the global settings panel on the right-hand side of the editor, can I export that to a theme.json format?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>The answer is not right now. I think there&#8217;s discussion in the teams about maybe building it, but it hasn&#8217;t been the highest priority because everything needs to work first before we start working on an exporter. But there are other parts of that can be exported in that full site editing experience that can be exported. So I think it would be a natural progression to add the ability to do a theme.json export.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes. Definitely there will be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> From the very beginning, there were designs in global style. Sorry. The reason I know is that was one thing I did partake on. There was exporting. So I have a feeling if we all wanted to play some little happy bets, there will be exploiting at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. But if we all bet on the same thing, it&#8217;s not really bet, right? Victor, as always, you&#8217;re a little bit ahead of the time. So and from Jan Horna, from the Czech Republic, it&#8217;s very hot by now there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has two questions as a theme developer, one, is the theme.json supposed to include all the styling, formatting definitions and replaced the CSS style? And I think we&#8217;d take it one at a time. So we talked a little bit about it from my question, but would it replace? You could still do all those styling in the style sheets as you want, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> And I think there are some things that will remain in other styling, but you could use the variables that you set or the properties that you set in your theme.json in your CSS. So they can work together. But I don&#8217;t think that theme.json, at least right now, will not completely replace an entire site&#8217;s design, especially if you have a very complex design.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-meta-charset-utf-8-why-do-we-want-to-rewrite-css-in-json\">Why do we want to rewrite CSS in JSON</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Yeah. And this was one of my first questions and honestly, skepticism early on of the proposal around this, is CSS is great. Why do we want to rewrite CSS in JSON. And then it slowly, I mean, other people are obviously smarter than me understood this quickly. It&#8217;s not about rewriting all of CSS. There&#8217;s definitely going to be aspects of your site, especially if you have taking, like you&#8217;re saying, more complicated designs that will remain in CSS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is about creating, I think, more of the foundational elements and understanding how the blocks will interact with your styles and having that single point of contact, I think is most important. So I think for me, at least it&#8217;s more about the foundational elements that are going to be placed and managed this way than replacing your entirety of your styles. Because this great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things like animations and transformation, and this is all really powerful stuff that I don&#8217;t imagine, really, at least in the super near future, having a big part of theme.json. To the question about, will you be able to save an export a theme.json from global styles? I think this is a really important thing to keep in mind is what I just showed you is kind of unnatural. I don&#8217;t imagine a future necessarily where theme developers are writing raw JSON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really, there&#8217;s not a great experience for it. It&#8217;s a configuration file. And so the more, to points that have already been raised, it&#8217;s about we&#8217;re in this phase now because we need to kind of identify and get it to work, and then we can kind of build an ecosystem around what would a really cool UI look like to generate one of these files? Is it native directly to global styles? How do we start to imagine those interfaces so the theme developers or theme designers can really get to the core of this experience too?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. Well, thank you. Good point. You wanted to say something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister: </em>Yeah. I was just going to say over time, CSS has gained so much. So I didn&#8217;t know about anyone else, but I had a block.css file that was getting bigger and bigger of supporting blocks and doing things. And something I&#8217;ve noticed that I can do is throw that file away, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier because what I can do now is lean into these defaults. I&#8217;m still going to have some lines of CSS, the output by whatever, a preprocessor, whatever, my happy little whatever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because everyone has got their own way and we should have our own way of doing it. But it&#8217;s a foundation, and it means that we&#8217;re not having to work around the editor or find different ways of doing it. I set up naturally a hack file for the editor out of habit. I haven&#8217;t filled it with anything yet in the latest theme I&#8217;ve been working on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m delighted if I never fill that up with anything on the next theme, because it means that the new way we&#8217;re doing things hasn&#8217;t had me to work around that. I can just use the foundation and create a really awesome experience on top of it. And that&#8217;s what we should be doing. We should be working with the editor, not having to work around it, or using not important like it was going out of fashion to go over control of it. It was this awkward middle ground we were working in trying to make things fit that paradigm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And I think that fits right into the next question from Jan Horna again, and he says so as a block theme developer, should I focus from a strategic point of view on theme.json block styles, or block patterns. In other words, how do I differentiate? It&#8217;s kind of a high-level question there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D<em>aisy Olsen: </em>I would say all of the above. They&#8217;re all important things. And your block styles are part of theme.json, I would say. But block patterns are really a powerful partner to the theme.json, that you can create building blocks for a site where you&#8217;ve got some really amazing very specific designed elements that could be used for different things on a site. So if you&#8217;re creating a commercial application that&#8217;s going to go out to a wide audience, they can be more generic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you have a client and you&#8217;re working as a freelancer or in an agency where you have a site that needs to have access to these things that they&#8217;re going to use more than once, patterns are a fantastic way to do that, where most of the work is done for them. They don&#8217;t have to reconfigure everything from the ground up every time they want to create something similar to what they&#8217;ve done before.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4-what-happens-when-you-update-the-color-palette-will-saved-blocks-have-the-new-colors\">What happens when you update the color palette? Will saved blocks have the new colors?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Thank you. And Spencer McCormick in the chat had a question. So what happens when you update the color palette or similar, for example, if you have a primary and secondary colors, when you update and change the palette colors, will saved blocks have the new colors? That&#8217;s an interesting question. Thank you, Spenser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> I can answer that to some extent. If you think of your palette as named colors, if you give the different hex code to the same name, it should apply to the site. But if you give it a new name, then that&#8217;s a new element, and it won&#8217;t apply to anything that already had an old name attached to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> There is a hefty discussion related to this question on the naming of colors in the way that Gutenberg wants to supply a default palette or a default set of named colors so that you could reliably&#8230; What we&#8217;re seeing I think is that I think patterns have been wanting to rely on specific colors across kind of, so you can guarantee oh, when corn flour shows up it&#8217;s always going to be corn flour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s always going to be available. There&#8217;s a lot of complication and nuance around it. But if, I think today, to answer your question, like Daisy is saying, today, if I were to supply a value or a named value here and then change it or take it out of my palette, then that would break the experience or it would no longer be applied to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s part of the challenge, how do we reliably solve for that? How do we give theme office the tools to figure that out. But now if they set a custom color, if you set a custom color on an element or a block, then that will remain because it&#8217;s a specific X value, but the class names will go away though, if they&#8217;re supplied by the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So great discussions. And I&#8217;m probably going to share, and if it&#8217;s one issue where that discuss the theme team every week kind of shares all the things that are discussed and that need input from the community or other theme developers on their make blog. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is definitely a place to go to chime in and we&#8217;ll find all the discussions that are happening. And then chime in in the ones that you find important and that you are worried about. So Tim Bowen has the question, how does the theme.json handle responsive sizes for font sizes especially. Responsive sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>By default, I&#8217;m not sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> You&#8217;ve stomped the panelists. Yes, we did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> I mean, you can use not just pixel values for your fonts, so-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> That&#8217;s what I was going to say. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie Lister: &#8230; that helps. And I think it&#8217;s a work in progress. So things like responsive and breakpoints. But the now answer is you don&#8217;t have to just use pixels. And Jeff just gave a great leak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je<em>ff Ong: </em>I just dropped the issue in that has not seen a lot of activity around it, but the idea of media. So the first part of your question on font sizes, there are ways of calculating this where they&#8217;re not pixel values tied to specific viewports. You could supply a calculated value, for example, in your small&#8230; that is based on a viewport size. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s kind of a paradigm shift or design paradigm shift of getting away from you must be 12 pixels under below 600 pixel viewport width, to more of are we okay with kind of a fluid typography kind of system? That being said, there are instances where you need media queries, and that is not currently&#8230; I don&#8217;t know how actively that&#8217;s being worked on right now. But a wonderful thing open to contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So Patty has a comment and a question after that, Patty O&#8217;Hara, I most often develop custom themes for clients and hand them off for the clients to update the content. And playing around with new tools, I&#8217;m excited to start using them, but don&#8217;t want to give access to global standards to anyone with admin access. Will the granularity of permissions changes so that I can block access to changing fonts and colors from within the admin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> I think this amazing thing happens in where also Jeff showed some of the control you can do. So in the demo, there was some control that you can do. But my process is a history of configurability and being able to do that be it in code, or be it in a plugin. But I honestly think we need to be a little bit cautious. This is my personal opinion here, and we need to maybe embrace allowing people to do styling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can set boundaries, you can set branding boundaries, you can set pallets, you can set topography. But we need to move away a little bit from having such pixel fixated control in that sense and think about safely within boundaries, expression of these tools. And that people can create really amazing things, and you can maintain branding that way, and it can empower someone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These themes are becoming style guides, and that&#8217;s something that is known in the corporate world and used within that space as well. It&#8217;s a term, but it&#8217;s kind of democratizing design in that sense in giving people all these tools to play with, and I think it&#8217;s a huge change in the way that we&#8217;ve done things, but I think it&#8217;s really, really important and really, really empowering to the people that are using our themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>That&#8217;s a good advocacy for set it free. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> But you&#8217;re allowed to have boundaries. I think you can set it free, but be comfortable about some boundaries. I think sometimes when we say set it free, it can be scary because we don&#8217;t say you&#8217;re allowed to have some boundaries, but with pallets and with these style guides, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re saying. You&#8217;re saying I&#8217;m making these good decisions for you and you can choose from this platform of good decisions. And that&#8217;s kind of awesome. I think,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. I like the plea for block patterns that Daisy just a couple of minutes had that block patterns also give you the possibility or the option to actually provide different facets of how a section can be organized or styled within the style design system that you build with the block add on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that there is a lot of creativity that will come from that as well. So Tim Bowen is brave and contemplating, is it safe to use the theme.json now for a project launching in August? Would we just activate the Gutenberg plugin and add JSON file? Or is there more to it? I would love to move away from our functions in Editor.js method probably as soon as possible. So what would we say to Tim?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> The theme is not a block theme, as in it doesn&#8217;t use HTML templates, then I probably wouldn&#8217;t put the Gutenberg plugin on a production website, unless you are ready to deal with unexpected things happening. But placing your theme.json file in your classic theme on the 5.8 beta or release candidate that will be coming, I would start testing there and see if the things that you&#8217;re putting in your theme.json file work with 5.8 on a classic theme. That&#8217;d be my suggestion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> I think if it&#8217;s launching in August, that means 5.8 should be out. She tries to check her mental calendar. So I think tests. I, personally, am okay. I would consider it if it was going into a site, but I would also want to know how many users were using it, what their levels was, what they were doing, what they were going to create, and how they were going to do it. So it&#8217;s a&#8230; this is not legal advice. I feel that there should be [inaudible 00:50:36] advice that I can be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Don&#8217;t try this at home. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> But by then, 5.8 should be out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. 5.8 comes out July 20th, that&#8217;s at least the schedule for that. So we ran out of questions right now one the Q and A sessions here. Well, you&#8217;re welcome, Tim. Good luck with that, and let us know. Is there more to the setting it up besides just activating the plugin or adding the JSON file. Well, back to kind of using it and editing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When there are already themes available in the theme repository that use the full set up for full site editing and use all the template parts and templates with the blocks, and header blocks, and photo blocks, and all that. But I&#8217;m not quite sure of that yet. Be careful about the using the Gutenberg plugin in production. It always has a few hiccups there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it wasn&#8217;t the first time ever that I retreated to the last version when I had one and had to wait till one, two, or three point releases to come out. So I&#8217;m hesitant to say do it in production. Test it as much as possible. So I have a lot of things on my screen, but not the right thing. Here, so it is. Oh, Ryan, we are pretty good time wise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I don&#8217;t have an additional&#8230; So, when we say how to get started, what was the first thing most difficult part for you for learning, or was there a mind shift until it clicked? Just to kind of get away from a fear of learning something new, and was there something when you go back ages on the theme.json thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Tammie Lister: </em></strong>So for me, it was realizing it wasn&#8217;t as hard as I maybe mentally thought it was. It was just the same with learning anything. You always think it&#8217;s going to be super hard, or at least with me, I read like dev doc and I&#8217;m like&#8230; My brain makes that noise. And then I just letting my theme be lighter. Letting it take the weight of that, giving up control, which as someone that&#8217;s maybe a bit of an old themer, giving up control of things, that&#8217;s an interesting process to go through. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s really important embracing those foundations. And when you do, there&#8217;s that mind shift of creating in the editor. That was the moment that&#8230; And I&#8217;m still going through the process. I think it&#8217;s a process, and it&#8217;s a process as these tools are evolving. We&#8217;re talking about be gentle, they&#8217;re in production. These tools are still evolving and working.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are using these tools now before it&#8217;s released, then you&#8217;re going to hit bugs and report them. But that&#8217;s the thing. This theme.json also&#8230; the moment I kind of, the Jenga box, the blocks fell in my brain was I stopped seeing it as global stars. And I knew it wasn&#8217;t just global stars, but I felt it wasn&#8217;t just global stars and this felt like it could be the backbone of my theme, and it felt like it wasn&#8217;t everything in my theme, but it felt like it could be the backbone, is the best way I can describe it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I could hang my theme from it. And we&#8217;ve hung our theme from functions.php wrongly, I think. So it was just that change from PHP to doing it all in the editor and creating and seeing that JSON. It just was free, and it&#8217;s more in line with how things are made outside WordPress, which I think is delightful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Any comments from you that you want to add, Daisy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>So when I first started working with a theme.json file, I found that I had to&#8230; So there&#8217;s a whole section called styles, and I had to realign my thinking about what that meant, because what it&#8217;s saying is there are style settings in your blocks or for your site level depending on how it&#8217;s being applied, and what you&#8217;re doing is configuring the defaults for it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I think of the theme.json file as a default file, then it helped me frame it so that I&#8217;m not necessarily replacing my CSS depending on&#8230; I mean, I&#8217;m letting theme.json do the heavy lifting, kind of like Tammie said, but then I can take it further if I feel like I need to, or I want to. So I like thinking of it as a configuration file or a defaults file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s a good point. Jeff, do you have any stories how I came about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff Ong: It&#8217;s been really helpful to pair on it with people, to work on a theme with someone. I think if my team at Automattic. It&#8217;s a very culture of collaboration, and if you have the opportunity to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m having trouble with this. Would you want to work on this?&#8221; With someone like that, because this definitely can be a head bashing kind of why is this not being applied? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I literally just wrote color green. Why is it not green? It can be so frustrating dealing with that. So to have someone just to look at your code and be like &#8220;Oh, you missed a comma or actually you need an extra key there&#8221; is really, really helpful for something like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh yeah. So well, I think we&#8217;re coming to the end of our show. This has been very interesting and inspiring. So thank you all so much. And for those who want to dive into at a guided kind of testing session, Anne McCarthy, who, as you might know, runs the Full Site Editing Outreach program, she&#8217;s about to post the eighth call for testing, and it will all be about the theme.json file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as soon as it&#8217;s out, I will share a link in the show notes. And of course, also if you subscribed to our Gutenberg Times newsletter, you will definitely be informed about that. So at this point, I only have two more questions for our panelists. So do you have any announcements that you couldn&#8217;t get out before and you want the people to keep in mind? And if people want to get in touch with you, what would be the best way. Tammie, you want to start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Yeah. So I&#8217;m comatose in all the things. I&#8217;m pretty easy to find in a good way. And I love chatting to people. So please do. I think my thing to say would be remember all of what happening now you can help shape. Just because we&#8217;ve sat here talking about it doesn&#8217;t mean we know anything more than you? It just means we&#8217;ve poked it and we&#8217;ve played around with the code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So do that. Start exploring it. And it&#8217;s a lot more accessible than it ever was. It&#8217;s starting to be more accessible. There&#8217;s more documentation than there ever was coming out. And if you care about what happens with themes or you ever cared about what happens to themes, and maybe you could have that reignited, start to join the conversation. And I guess my final point would be, I think my hope is to see this experimentation come back to themes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we forgot about that a little bit and we need to have some fun again in these. We used to have so much fun in WordPress themes, and I look forward to not just themes to have a purpose, but just themes that are art, themes that are just wacky experiments, and start enjoying theming and make some art. I&#8217;m really excited to see what things people create and use them just for one day even. That&#8217;d be amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So Jeff, anything you want to have people keep in mind, and how to get in contact with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Yeah. Contact at J-F-F-N-G. And I guess keeping in mind, I&#8217;m just building on the last thing Tammie said, perhaps find a way to have fun with it and get curious about it, and try it. There&#8217;s really to me, a fundamental tendance of learning about something or you just have, how do I get curious about this thing? How do I play with it and have fun? And that&#8217;s going to be the most important thing to keep in at the center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Thank you, Jeff, and thank you so much for the audio work on the demo. Daisy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> I&#8217;m Daisy Olsen on most things, Olsen with an E, and I would say that as far as what you can do as the next step if you&#8217;re interested in learning more about this, is go to&#8230; I&#8217;m pretty sure that Birgit has a link to this somewhere, the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/\">theme experiments repository on GitHub</a> in the WordPress space has things that other people have done or are working on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I love to see examples of something in action to help me learn more about it and to see what other people have done. So I would say go check out something.json files in there and see what people have come up with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Awesome. Thank you so much. So big thank you to Daisy, Jeff, and Tammie to come today and make your time. A big thank you also for the viewers with all your great questions. I think we got a great array of it. And if you have more questions, you can always send them to me via email to <a href=\"mailto:pauli@gutenbergtimes.com\">pauli@gutenbergtimes.com</a>, and I&#8217;ll get you the answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the recording of the show will be available in a few minutes on our YouTube channel. And I&#8217;ll share all the links then also in the video description. And within a few days, we will have also a transcript that we will publish on the Gutenbergtimes.com. So be well, good-bye, and good luck. That was fun. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff Ong: Thank you, everyone.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 26 Jun 2021 17:23:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"WPTavern: Major Revamp Coming to GitHub Issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119005\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:137:\"https://wptavern.com/major-revamp-coming-to-github-issues?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=major-revamp-coming-to-github-issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2872:\"<p>This week GitHub unveiled new features that will be included in a total revamp of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://github.com/features/issues\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub Issues</a>, including project tables that are similar to spreadsheets, custom fields, a keyboard driven command palette, improved task lists, and issue forms.

Tools that hard-code a specific methodology are too rigid and complex to flex to whatever the moment demands.

Instead of the user-centric call for testing features from the UI, program lead Anne McCarthy <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/06/24/call-for-testing-thrive-with-theme-json/\">asks that volunteers dive into code</a>. The new adventure is all about testing <code>theme.json</code> files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The twist is likely to limit the pool of usual volunteers. However, it could open it up to an audience that may have been sitting on the sideline for the previous tests: theme developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before jumping headfirst <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/\">theme JSON files</a>, we should probably all get on the same page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been calling <code>theme.json</code> the tipping point between the old WordPress and the new WordPress. When version 5.0 of the core platform launched in late 2018, it was a revolutionary step forward, but not on the surface. A new editor is just a new editor. Some will love it; others will hate it.  And, it was more often clunky than not.  For the most part, WordPress was still WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The core software was due for an upending. Newer technologies were not only democratizing publishing in their own ways, but they were also bringing that same concept to design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of blocks was merely foundational. The new editor was an imperfect tool, often feeling like the proverbial round peg being shoved into a square hole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way to live out the early vision of the Gutenberg project was to continue bridging the gap between what the user sees in the admin and what gets output on the front end. That is what the <code>theme.json</code> file is all about. It is a translator that allows users, themes, and WordPress to all speak the same language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What does this mean exactly?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a user&rsquo;s viewpoint, they see all sorts of controls for changing their blocks. Color, font size, alignment, and other options are tools that allow them to customize their content.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Customizing a profile card for my cat using block options.\n\n\n\n<p>There are severe limitations with what is possible in the current system. Theme authors can register a handful of options. Outside of that, the theme and block systems can feel like they are pitted against each other for control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is where the <code>theme.json</code> file comes in. It allows themes and WordPress to get on the same page, creating a standardized system that improves the user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This file that lives a theme&rsquo;s root folder hands over the power to configure dozens of presets (e.g., color and font options), custom CSS properties, and default styles for blocks and HTML elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also gives themers the power to enable or disable specific features. For example, developers can turn off the ability for users to set a custom font size but provide access to their perfect scale of choices that fit into the design&rsquo;s vertical rhythm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it will move beyond the simple configuration of blocks in the content editor. When the global styles system launches alongside the site editor in the future, users will customize many of the presets and overwrite the default block styles. Because everyone is speaking that same language, fewer conflicts arise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As designer Tammie Lister pointed out in her piece for Ephermeral Themes, <a href=\"https://ephemeralthemes.com/2021/06/20/theme-json-inspires/\">Theme.json inspires</a>, themes have been stuck. The software, the community, has put too much responsibility on the shoulders of themers over the years. They have had to innovate and build the systems that should have been coming from WordPress. Not only did the core platform need to be turned on its head, but the design system deserved an overhaul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I am very aware that saying &lsquo;first major theme process to core&rsquo; in years is quite a statement,&rdquo; wrote Lister. &ldquo;Theme.json to me is that though. I don&rsquo;t say this ignoring iterations and improvements, WordPress is a project flowing with the energy of those. However, themes were on life support stuck in a land when the rest of front end development was moving on. It wasn&rsquo;t for some trying to change that, mostly when they did the time wasn&rsquo;t right and as it didn&rsquo;t come from core it was always a harder change.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is time for a new front-end design era. But, first, we must test.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Testing Theme JSON</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Real-world theme.json file.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The more I journeyed into this call for testing, the more I realized it did not feel right for me. Over the past couple of months, I have already been in the thick of working from the <code>theme.json</code> file. I know most of the little quirks and see the gaps. The tricks for working with it feel second nature to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have performed all of the beginner and intermediate steps dozens upon dozens of times. I have already filed tickets for any issues I have run into. Or, someone else has already beat me to the punch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those stages of this testing round need fresh eyes. The best feedback will be from theme authors who will be viewing the problems through a different pair of lenses.  If you are in this group, there is no time like the present to test and provide feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advanced stage calls for recreating a classic theme using <code>theme.json</code>. It is best to stick with something simple. Otherwise, you could be looking at a weeks-long experiment. McCarthy recommends Twenty Twenty or Storefront. I have already been performing this song and dance too. My test project was an old theme that I gutted and turned into a block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one overarching issue that I keep coming back to. It is that theme authors must work from a JSON file at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind using JSON. It is a universal format that we can pass around from JavaScript to PHP. Third-party APIs can understand it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I am currently sitting on top of 900+ lines of code in my <code>theme.json</code>. I have heard from a couple of other theme authors who have been doing deep work with similar numbers. I expect it to only grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Number of lines&rdquo; is not necessarily some metric where a specific total is a dividing point between &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad.&rdquo; The problem is that comments are not allowed in JSON files. One of the cornerstones of sound development is documenting code. Skipping out on documentation of a few dozen lines is not so bad. However, when you speed past 900, things can get out of hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, at a certain point, you start wanting to split pieces into their own groups. This much code is begging for better organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing that is currently missing is a PHP layer for theme authors to use. Remember, JSON is a universal format. It is easy to convert PHP to JSON and vice-versa. Building in this layer for theme authors would accomplish two things:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>They can organize what will likely be 1,000s of lines of code.</li><li>It will be easier to transition to the new system.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter point is likely the most salient. PHP has been the language of theming since the theming has been around. Developers know it and are comfortable using it, and WordPress should meet them in the middle. If we are closing gaps, this is the one that needs filling before more configuration possibilities are added and <code>theme.json</code> files balloon into unwieldy, 5,000-line behemoths.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 26 Jun 2021 03:30:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.8 Beta 4\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10855\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/06/wordpress-5-8-beta-4/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3891:\"<p>WordPress 5.8 Beta 4 is now available for testing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong>&nbsp;so it is not recommended to run this version on a production site.

The update overhauls the Query and Query Loop blocks, allows users to expand or collapse items in the editor list view, and introduces rich URL preview cards for links. The new version also packs in an updated template-mode <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32427\">creation modal</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32166\">moves the blocks manager</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This update ships several enhancements, particularly to the user experience. One of my favorite low-key upgrades is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32371\">a new set</a> of add-card, bug, key, post author, and security icons by Filipe Varela, a product designer at Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another small-but-packs-a-punch UI change is the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32609\">inclusion of the post type</a> in the editor breadcrumb trail. The type&rsquo;s singular name label now replaces the root &ldquo;Document&rdquo; item.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past several cycles, the new template editor slated to launch with WordPress 5.8 has been enabled by default. The goal was always to allow everyone the chance to experience it, regardless of whether they were on a classic or block theme. The development team has now scaled this back to only be <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32858\">auto-enabled for block themes</a>. Classic themes must opt-in to support it. Theme authors should read the recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/16/introducing-the-template-editor-in-wordpress-5-8/\">template editor overview</a> by Riad Benguella for the complete details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Query and Query Loop Blocks Renamed</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Query Loop block in the editor.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><em>Query? Query Loop? What the heck is all this?</em> If you are unfamiliar with those terms, you are not alone. Even on the developer end, the early implementation of the Query and its inner Query Loop block could be a little confusing. For the average user, it probably makes even less sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 10.9 takes one step toward <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32514\">clearing up this confusion</a> for end-users. The former Query Loop block is now named Post Template. This is a far more accurate description of what it does. It is the &ldquo;template&rdquo; that outputs individual posts. It contains all the things you see, such as the post content or excerpt, the featured image, tags, categories, and more. This template is, of course, customizable via the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this is a step toward a less complex user experience, it is not quite where it needs to be yet. The Query block has been renamed to Query Loop. Therein lies the remaining issue. The terminology might still be confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is to expose a variation of this block named Posts List to users. It already exists, but the query-related terminology still appears when using it. There is an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/32268\">open ticket to address this</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary win with this update is the overhauled text in the Query Loop block sidebar. &ldquo;The query block is a powerful and complex block,&rdquo; said lead Gutenberg developer Matias Ventura in a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32694\">GitHub ticket</a>. &ldquo;It can be intimidated to users without proper guidance. We can use this block as an opportunity to explain some of the underlying concepts of the WordPress software in a more didactic manner.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more advanced options, such as whether to inherit from the URL and which post types to include, now have longer descriptions. Each should guide the user through features that have long existed in the developer world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a theme author and have already been building with these two blocks, do not worry about everything breaking when updating. The Query block has simply been renamed to &ldquo;Query Loop&rdquo; in user-facing text. Under the hood, it is still the same. The former Query Loop block has literally been renamed to Post Template (<code>core/post-template</code> block name). It is backward compatible. However, you should update any past calls to the <code>wp:query-loop</code> block to <code>wp:post-template</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Expand and Collapse Nested List View Blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />List view with collapsed nested blocks.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The development team introduced an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32117\">expand/collapse feature</a> for the editor&rsquo;s list view. Once opening the panel, users should now see arrow icons next to each item with nested blocks. Closing one or more of them makes it easier to see all or many top-level blocks at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside is that the open/close state is lost once the list view is closed. If I had one request, it would be to store this data while editing the post. That would improve the user experience with longer documents, particularly when switching between navigating and editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This update, along with the persistent behavior of the list view in Gutenberg 10.7, has made for a much more well-rounded document navigation experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rich URL Previews</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The editor will now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/31464\">show a website preview</a> in the link editor popup. This feature only works for links in a Rich Text context, such as in the Paragraph, Heading, and List blocks. The preview also only appears after the link has been set and clicked on, not when initially typing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If available, the popup preview displays the site icon, title, image, and description.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In the near future however, we expect to extend this to provide previews of internal URLs and to roll out support to more areas of the software,&rdquo; wrote George Mamadashvili in the Gutenberg 10.9 announcement post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, I was not keen on the idea of adding this feature. It felt like unnecessary bloat when more pressing issues were lying on the table. However, in the past day, I have enjoyed the quick previews when double-checking links in posts.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 02:34:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"WPTavern: Jetpack Launches New Mobile App\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=118883\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:127:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-launches-new-mobile-app?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=jetpack-launches-new-mobile-app\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3798:\"<div><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic has launched a new <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2021/06/21/jetpack-mobile-app/\">mobile app for Jetpack</a>, available on iOS and Android. The app features an array of Jetpack-specific features, as well as those applicable to users on paid plans, along with core WordPress features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside it looks nearly identical to the official WordPress mobile apps, but it is noticeably missing WordPress.com specific features like the Reader. The bottom menu links to &ldquo;My Site&rdquo; and &ldquo;Notifications.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who are on paid Jetpack plans will have access to features like backups, restores, and security scanning for use inside the app when on the go. It also includes the same Activity Log and Stats features found in the main WordPress app. In its current state, it doesn&rsquo;t look like the app offers anything more than what you are used to on the standard mobile apps unless you are a <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/features/comparison/\">paid Jetpack customer</a>. So far, the app doesn&rsquo;t include any upgrade paths for free users or to jump from plan to plan. If Automattic decides to add in-app purchases, it will have to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-tangles-with-apple-over-lack-of-in-app-purchases-in-the-wordpress-for-ios-app\">share the revenue with the app stores</a>. Having a separate app from the official mobile apps gives the company the option to build in more direct paths for monetization in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You may want to stick with the official WordPress apps if you manage both WordPress.com and Jetpack-enabled sites, to keep everything conveniently in the same place. If you decide to use both apps, you will want to remove your Jetpack sites from the main WordPress app so that you aren&rsquo;t getting double notifications from having the site accessible through both apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic&rsquo;s integrated products remain controversial features of the official WordPress apps. It is a good move to separate self-hosted Jetpack sites from the clutter of having WordPress.com-specific features in the app, but it does little for improving the official app&rsquo;s experience for self-hosted users who are not using Jetpack. Clicking on Stats in the app still prompts users to install Jetpack when managing self-hosted sites. The Reader menu item is ever-present at the bottom of the page. These products take up screen real estate regardless of whether they are being used. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A toggle to turn off these features in the app&rsquo;s settings might be a good stop-gap measure towards disentanglement, but ultimately the official mobile apps should not promote any commercial interests. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Automattic moved WordPress.com features into the Jetpack app, then anyone using the company&rsquo;s products could be directed to this app for managing their sites. The official WordPress app could then be kept free of any products that the user doesn&rsquo;t choose to install. If the vanilla state of the app is not enough, users can be prompted to add themes and plugins to enhance the WordPress experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Jetpack app is aimed at people who have sites using Jetpack but don&rsquo;t need the WordPress.com features that are built into the official WordPress apps. It brings more value to those who are on paid plans and want access to those features on the go. More than 500 people have already downloaded the Android app. It will be interesting to see if Jetpack users will gravitate towards the new app or remain on the standard WordPress app for more centralized management of Jetpack and non-Jetpack enabled websites.  </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 17:59:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: Clove: A Showcase of Block Patterns by Anariel Design\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119011\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:169:\"https://wptavern.com/clove-a-showcase-of-block-patterns-by-anariel-design?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=clove-a-showcase-of-block-patterns-by-anariel-design\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5403:\"<img />Clove theme homepage.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Earlier today, Ana Segota <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ana_Segota/status/1407694456418152458\">tweeted</a> and <a href=\"https://www.anarieldesign.com/free-full-site-editing-theme-clove/\">announced</a> via the Anariel Design blog that her company had submitted its second block-based theme to WordPress.org. Clove is a more well-rounded follow-up to her first such theme, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/anariel-design-launches-naledi-a-block-based-wordpress-theme\">Naledi</a>. It is currently under review for inclusion in the official directory, but anyone can give it a test run by snagging the ZIP file from <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/101349\">its ticket</a>. Or, just peruse the <a href=\"https://anarieldesign.com/themedemos/clove/\">live demo</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This should officially be the 10th <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">block-based theme</a> to go live in the WordPress.org theme directory (note that a couple by Automattic are not tagged). That is assuming all goes well during the review process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been a long road thus far, but 10 themes with the Full Site Editing tag is a notable milestone. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/exploring-full-site-editing-with-the-q-wordpress-theme\">Q theme</a> by Ari Stathopoulos was the first to land in the directory back in October 2020. Now, eight months later, there is still room for other theme authors to become pioneers in the space. With almost no competition, who will design that first block theme that squeezes its way into the most popular list?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If &ldquo;practice makes perfect,&rdquo; Segota is now ahead of the curve by pushing her second theme to the directory. This makes her theme company only one of two with multiple block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clove is experimental, as all block themes are. It relies on the ever-shifting parts of the Gutenberg plugin, but it all comes together into a floral, nature-themed design. There are hints of inspiration from Twenty Twenty-One, but it feels more structured, less chaotic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design is less of a theme and more of a showcase of block patterns and styles. Even on the template level, it reuses those same elements across each of its seven templates, providing multiple entryways for users to tinker with its features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clove even includes pricing columns.  I seem to recall writing about how theme authors could <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/you-might-not-need-that-block\">implement them via patterns</a> just over a month ago. Maybe the Anariel Design team came to the same conclusion. Maybe they took my message and ran with it. I like to think the latter is true. Either way, the result is a beautiful, theme-specific pattern &mdash; the sort of artistry that is tough to achieve from a plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Customizing the Pricing Columns pattern in the WordPress editor.\n\n\n\n<p>I am less of the fan of the overlapping and uneven columns in some of the designs designs, preferring some of the more-structured patterns, such as Three Quotes Images:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Three-column pattern that showcases images along with quotes.\n\n\n\n<p>Despite my general dislike of the uneven column style, my favorite piece of the entire theme is the Illustrations page template, which leans into that design method.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The page intro section is an announcement to the world, &ldquo;Hey, check out my work.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Illustrations template intro section.\n\n\n\n<p>I also like the Illustrations page template&rsquo;s widgets-like area in the footer. It manages to stuff several blocks in without feeling too crowded. It even showcases a box for artists to highlight their next exhibition.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Illustrations page template footer &ldquo;widget&rdquo; area.\n\n\n\n<p>The Clove theme also registers 10 block styles for users to choose from. Most of them add different types of borders or frames to various elements. Plus, there is the fun-but-kind-of-an-oddball blob &ldquo;Shape&rdquo; for images.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img />Latest Posts &ndash; Dividers</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img />Image &ndash; Framed</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img />Image &ndash; Shape</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Segota was one of several people to submit custom designs to the upcoming block pattern directory. There is some noticeable crossover between her current theme work and submissions, such as the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/issues/149\">Playful Gallery</a> pattern that did not quite make the cut. Others, like her <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/recipe/\">Recipe design</a>, did. There is still an <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/open-invitation-to-contribute-to-the-wordpress-block-pattern-directory\">open invitation for people to contribute</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am always like a kid in a toy store when a new block theme comes along, reaching out to grab the latest gadget. I want to see more experiments like Clove. Keep them coming, theme authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Side note:</strong> For people interested in the background-clipped text design used in Clove&rsquo;s site logo, I <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/32787\">opened a ticket</a> to take us one step closer to doing it in the editor. Currently, users must create an off-site image and upload it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 01:23:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WordPress Foundation: Answering FAQs on WordPress Trademarks and their usage\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/?p=189036\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/2021/answering-faqs-on-wordpress-trademarks-and-their-usage/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6388:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The WordPress Foundation owns and <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/\">manages trademarks</a> for the WordPress and WordCamp names and <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/about/logos/\">logos</a>. Over the years, many people have approached us with questions on WordPress trademarks and how to use them. This blog post aims to address some of the most common questions and clarify the usage of WordPress trademarks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can I use “WordPress” in my name?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Strictly speaking, you cannot use “WordPress” in your website name or your product name. As mentioned in the <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/\">WordPress Foundation trademarks page</a>:  </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Permission from the WordPress Foundation is required to use the WordPress or WordCamp name or logo as part of any project, product, service, domain name, or company name.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of trademark law is to keep others from using or misusing a trademarked name or logo. But it cannot stop them from picking it up. Sometimes, people use “WordPress” in their name, title, URL, or username when “WordPress” really does not belong there. However, such uses of the trademark violate the WordPress trademark nevertheless, and cannot be allowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is the actual trademark Policy?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find the entire written Trademark policy on the <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/\">Trademarks policy page</a> of this website. In short, the purpose of this policy is to make it easy for anyone to use the WordPress or WordCamp name or logo for community efforts that spread and improve WordPress. It also aims to make it difficult for anyone to use the WordPress or WordCamp name or logo to trick or confuse people looking for official WordPress or WordCamp resources. When you are in doubt, ask yourself this question: <em>“Is this an “official” WordPress event or resource?” </em>If the answer is “no,” then you should leave the trademarked name “WordPress” or “WordCamp” out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Does this mean I cannot build something for WordPress?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NO. </strong>The trademark policy <strong>does not</strong> restrict people from building anything for WordPress. WordPress, both the software and the community surrounding it, is open source. It takes all kinds of contributors to create, build, support, maintain, educate, and energize WordPress. But it does mean if you are creating something within the WordPress space that is not officially part of the WordPress project, you should not use the name “WordPress” to name it. However, you can use an alternative name like “WP” instead of “WordPress” for your products.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I was unaware of the Trademark policy and already created something using “WordPress” in the name or the URL. What do I do now?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you happen to be in that position and you want to figure out how to fix things, please feel free to reach out to <a href=\"mailto:trademarks@wordpressfoundation.org\">trademarks@wordpressfoundation.org</a> (or send us a message through the <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/\">contact form</a> on this site), and someone will help you bring your site, event, or product into compliance with the WP Trademark.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Does the trademark policy apply to WordPress swag?&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Using the WordPress logo in products or any sort of swag is not permitted. Without express permission from WordPress Foundation, you cannot sell WordPress goods or co-brand your goods to make them seem affiliated with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, WordPress swag (shirts, stickers, bags, hand sanitizer, stuffed animals, sweatshirts, mugs, cups, pencils… to name a few) &#8211; given out at a WordCamp is okay. Branded WordPress swag from sponsors at a WordCamp is also allowed. This is because the swag is being given out for free (not for profit) at an official WordPress event, and has been approved. You can also find approved WordPress swag in the <a href=\"https://mercantile.wordpress.org/\">official WordPress swag store</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reading all this, I realize someone I know is not in compliance with the Trademark. What should I do?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing is to remember that this person could be unaware they are not complying with the trademark. We want to assume good intent whenever possible. You can talk to them about it if you feel comfortable or even just share <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/\">the trademark policy</a> with them. Alternatively, you can submit information to the <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/contact/\">Trademarks contact form</a> on the site or send an email to trademarks@wordpressfoundation.org and let someone there do the work of assuming good intent and reaching out to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I have already reported this site/thing/person, and nothing has been done!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of resolving trademark issues takes a while, so we have assigned more bandwidth to speed up the process.  If you have reported something in the past, know that it is being worked on in the coming months. If you are worried that it got lost, you are welcome to send it in again. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is there anything I can do to help?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest help anyone in WordPress can give is to respect the Trademark themselves. I know that it seems like passive work for many, and you may be looking to do something actively. Being an active and respectful part of a community is a big help, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This post is based on </em><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/03/30/tuesday-trainings-can-i-use-wordpress-in-my-product-name/\"><em>Part 1</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/04/06/tuesday-trainings-can-i-use-wordpress-in-my-product-name-part-2-of-2/\"><em>Part 2</em></a><em> of the “Can I use “WordPress” in my product name?” </em><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/tuesdaytrainings/\"><em>Tuesday Training</em></a><em> from </em><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/camikaos\"><em>@camikaos</em></a><em> in the </em><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\"><em>Make WordPress Communities</em></a><em> blog.</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 09:08:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Hari Shanker\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 04:45:30 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 04:30:11 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20201016172007\";}', 'no');

Unlike manual updates, there’s no need to initiate the process or download new versions of your existing plugins and themes. In WordPress 5.5, site owners can choose whether or not to use the auto-update feature. For example, if your WordPress site is integrated with one of the many <a href=\"https://www.ringcentral.co.uk/gb/en/blog/definitions/cloud-management-platform/\">cloud management platforms</a> available, it will be automatically updated without you having to lift a finger. Each plugin and theme has its own ON/OFF option specifically for auto-updates.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1161135\" src=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"990\" height=\"661\" srcset=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1.png 990w, https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1-980x654.png 980w, https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-1-480x320.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 990px, 100vw\" /></a></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the risks?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever kind of business you&#8217;re running &#8211; be it a small eCommerce store or a </span><a href=\"https://accelerateagency.ai/saas-marketing-agency\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SaaS digital marketing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> agency, before enabling auto-updates on your WordPress site, it’s important to be aware of all the ‘side-effects’ &#8211; both good and bad. Auto-updates are convenient, but there can be some big drawbacks. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Updates can cause technical issues</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Updates have been known to sometimes cause problems on your website. This is more likely if you opt for comprehensive auto-updates across all plugins and themes. Updates will run in the background and you won’t even be aware of it most of the time. But sometimes updates cause technical issues or even ‘breaks’. Auto-updates can fail, especially when concurrent updates are happening simultaneously &#8211; with site functionality (e.g. </span><a href=\"https://vwo.com/blog/mobile-optimization-importance/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mobile optimization</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) more likely to go askew. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Updates can be hard to keep track of</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If an update does mess up your site, you will need to know what caused it. Determining exactly what happened and when can be tricky. Especially if multiple updates all took place simultaneously. With selected automatic and manual updates, it can be easier to isolate the root issue and fix it. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some major releases may be incompatible</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes auto-updates might include a major release. If a particular plugin (e.g. a plugin used to </span><a href=\"https://www.codemotion.com/magazine/dev-hub/cloud-manager/how-to-monitor-cloud-metrics-for-scaling/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">monitor cloud metrics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) releases an update with a larger than normal installation base, it could cause problems. If you have auto-update enabled, you won’t have any control over whether or not you wish to deploy those changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WordPress does not use a ‘Canary update’ testing process. Canary updates roll out code to test sites before official release. Without this, there’s no telling what a new update will do. Likewise with smaller plugins, top-notch quality assurance is not guaranteed. By enabling auto-updates you’re essentially handing over control to unknown quality assurance teams. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1161136\" src=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-2.png 800w, https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-2-480x216.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" /></a></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to run WordPress updates</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are safer ways to enjoy the benefits that automatic updates bring.

Now that you’re aware of some of those common issues, you can enjoy auto-updates without worrying too much about the consequences. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all the potential issues your site can be faced when updating your plugins and theme, it is vitally important to have a secure and recent backup of your site. There are tons of <a href=\"https://www.ringcentral.co.uk/gb/en/blog/definitions/anything-as-a-service-xaas/\">XaaS</a> tools available today and having a backup with </span><a href=\"http://updraftplus.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UpdraftPlus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help save you.

But how do you go about protecting your WordPress admin area?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the issues of security have remained challenging for many WordPress site owners. According to a report by WordPress security plugin</span><a href=\"https://wpmanageninja.com/wordpress-security-statistics/#:~:text=According%20to%20WordFence%2C%20there%20are,11%25%20are%20from%20WordPress%20Themes\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WordFence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, almost 90,000 security issues were reported every 60 seconds on WordPress websites in 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This data is even more troubling when we take into account login-based WordPress sites like eCommerce platforms, where sensitive information such as banking and debit card details are shared daily.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re trying to</span><a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/build-an-ecommerce-website/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">build a website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, using WordPress is a great idea, but you may be worried about the security of your WordPress admin area, especially given the sheer volume of cyber threats in the previous year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you wish to reinforce your log-in mechanics, consider these seven simple measures to secure your admin area.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Change your passwords often</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s start with the basics of WordPress admin and login security. It may seem like the simplest solution when it comes to your site’s security, but changing passwords is often overlooked as an effective security measure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This cybersecurity approach is essential to any login-based online service and should be implemented across all types of sites, from streaming platforms like Netflix, to social media sites like Instagram, to </span><a href=\"https://www.ringcentral.com/group-meeting-apps.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online group meeting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> apps like RingCentral. When it comes to preventing admin-related issues, changing a password regularly is a popular cybersecurity tactic. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Keep your plugins updated</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s go back to that WordFence data we mentioned earlier. In one</span><a href=\"https://wpmanageninja.com/wordpress-security-statistics/#:~:text=According%20to%20WordFence%2C%20there%20are,11%25%20are%20from%20WordPress%20Themes\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> conducted by WordFence researchers, it was found that over half of WordPress cybersecurity issues (52%) were caused by plugins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As such, he first step toward securing your WordPress site is investing in WordPress security plugins. Many of these track and record login attempts to analyze any possible admin area threats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, it’s important to</span><a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/why-defunct-wordpress-plugins-pose-a-threat-how-to-secure-your-site/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get rid of outdated WordPress plugins</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These pose a threat to your site’s security since they stop updating, meaning their security measures end up being lacking. The safest course of action is to uninstall them, as disabling doesn’t get rid of the additional (and weak) code. Use </span><a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/updraftcentral/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UpdraftCentral</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to efficiently manage, update and backup multiple website plugins, themes and backups from one place for sites on which UpdraftPlus is installed.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Implement SSL login pages</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SSL stands for “</span><a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/how-to-increase-security-while-developing-a-wordpress-site/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">secure sockets layer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”. This security protocol is generally used on websites that store sensitive data, especially those that require authentication to log in. In essence, SSL measures activate a digital lock &#8211; technically, an HTTPS protocol &#8211; that guarantees a secure connection from the server to the browser.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually your run-of-the-mill hosting provider will include these measures in your subscription. If they do not, consider purchasing an SSL certificate and installing it on your WordPress server. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is especially useful for eCommerce WordPress sites, which ask their clients to log in with a profile to automate the checkout process when paying via credit or debit card.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Limit login attempts</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restricting the number of possible login attempts is one reliable</span><a href=\"https://www.cleverfiles.com/howto/cybersecurity-tips-to-protect-data.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cybersecurity tip to protect data</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, especially if you’re looking to prevent potential brute force attacks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These cybersecurity breaches are achieved by bombarding an admin platform with every conceivable combination of characters to form passwords, using a simple but effective cracking method of trial and error. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By limiting login attempts, you can protect your users and your page from attacks of this nature.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pasted-image-0.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1144217 size-full\" src=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pasted-image-0.png\" alt=\"Limit login attempts WordPress security image\" width=\"1051\" height=\"701\" srcset=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pasted-image-0.png 1051w, https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pasted-image-0-980x654.png 980w, https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pasted-image-0-480x320.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1051px, 100vw\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/6pflEeSzGUo\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Image Source</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, when it comes to WordPress admin security issues, it’s important to note that not every hazardous log-in attempt comes from criminals looking to steal data. Sometimes, admin platforms are subjected to non-malicious intrusions performed by users.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re running a WordPress site that provides user registration, there’s a chance that your users – or yourself – will get locked out of their account by accident. Forgetting your password has happened to everyone at some point after all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to separate malware attacks and non-malicious intrusions is to implement a network intrusion detection system that can track, record, and analyze potential login or admin issues, without interfering with the traffic it monitors. This way, you can ensure you’re not punishing forgetful users, but are keeping them protected nonetheless.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Use two-factor authentication</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two-factor authentication is a security protocol that enforces an additional check on users looking to gain access to WordPress sites. This protection method adds an extra layer of security to passwords by asking for a unique one-use-only code that’s sent to your smartphone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These apps and plugins are installed on your smart device and will send the codes so you can access your WordPress login screen. This approach is seen as a more secure way of changing your passwords regularly and is particularly recommended for eCommerce sites.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Implement IAM solutions</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identity and access management (IAM) software solutions are used to limit the number of remote users accessing online platforms via admin areas and login accounts. In the digital era, the IAM market has grown rapidly and the current list of</span><a href=\"https://www.esecurityplanet.com/products/best-iam-software/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IAM solutions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> available can overwhelm newcomers and inexperienced WordPress site owners alike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a basic list of points to follow to make the most of your IAM service, regardless of which IAM option you choose. Here’s a shortlist of what to do before you commit to a particular provider:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Access the IT architecture.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for any possible incompatibilities between the OS, third-party application or plugins, and the IAM tool.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Verify that your IAM system is compliant with guidelines and laws in your industry, market, and country.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pasted-image-0-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1144218 size-full\" src=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pasted-image-0-1.png\" alt=\"Security WordPress image\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pasted-image-0-1.png 960w, https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pasted-image-0-1-480x320.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 960px, 100vw\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pixabay.com/es/photos/seguridad-protecci%C3%B3n-antivirus-265130/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Image Source</span></a></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7.

It may be difficult to read, but there’s a chance that even if you do everything right, hackers will still be able to gain access to and attack your admin area.

As well as lots of fixes and tweaks, there are several new features included. The first of these new features is the ‘Power Tweak’. This Premium feature allows you to change the meta_key field length and create a new index. This can significantly speed up database requests on websites with large post_meta tables. Power tweak works by tweaking the table’s schema to enable indexing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second new feature we have included in this release is the ‘Automatic backups’ feature. When using the new automatic backup feature, users can now use UpdraftPlus during scheduled optimizations. As such, database backups with UpdraftPlus can now run before automatic scheduled database optimization. The third new feature in this update is the ‘Keep last X revision’ update. This feature allows you to delete post revisions, but now gives you the option to keep a specified number of revisions. Before this update, users could only keep revisions by time setting only. This change gives users more flexibility and increased safety when making post revisions. . </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The updates to WP-Optimize 3.1.9 are available now and also includes the following:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FEATURE: Power Tweak &#8211;

Putting together all of your content, plugins and themes can be an overwhelming and time consuming process. As such it is all too easy to forget that there might be elements on your site that could cause an accessibility issue for people with hearing issues. If you want to build the best possible site for your users, designing it for accessibility can be both incredibly helpful and rewarding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we previously covered in our blog, issues like </span><a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/colour-blindness-wordpress-and-how-to-make-wordpress-sites-accessible-to-those-who-cant-see-colour/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">being colour blind</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can have a big impact on a users ability to properly use a website. In this blog, we will go into what changes you can also make so your site is more usable for those users with hearing issues. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you make a website accessible? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Website accessibility refers to the practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to websites by people with disabilities. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users have equal access to information and functionality. With regards to what issues designers may have to change to accommodate deaf users, lots of websites include introduction videos in their headers for example.

After just over a year of lockdowns, travel restrictions, nearly <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-toll/\">3 million deaths</a>, lost jobs, businesses closed forever; we have also undergone a change in working practices bigger than anything since the advent of the industrial revolution. We have all been thrown into unfamiliar situations and have had to adapt to leaving the traditional office environment behind and change to a new remote working situation. What have we all learned in the last year and what will this mean for the future of office work?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before Governments all over the world imposed nationwide lockdowns due to Covid &#8211; affecting nearly every office based business, employers were generally reluctant to allow those who could or wanted to work from home to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks for the imposed lockdown, call centre employees &#8211; once crammed into cramped and outdated offices by their hundreds to use a PC and headset that could literally be setup in any location with an internet connection, now had the type of work/life balance and freedom that was thought of as impractical and impossible previously. However, there remained a lingering and prevalent sense of the office ‘old-school manager mindset’ that believes workers need constant supervision and direction in order to properly do their jobs. This belief states that employees should always be within shouting distance and there are many managers still operating under the assumption that workers would use the opportunity of home working to skip work and become less productive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the global pandemic has forced the flexible working conversation to the forefront of employment relations, industries such as call-centres &#8211; that had stuck hard and steadfast to the traditional working pattern &#8211; have been forced to reevaluate just how effective the old way of working really was.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one knew exactly how the great working from home experiment would workout for employees or employers, let alone the kind of impact it would have on the economy. However after much speculation, studies have shown that it has been a huge success. A <a href=\"https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/2432442-uk-productivity-could-be-improved-by-a-permanent-shift-towards-remote-working,-research-shows\">recent study</a> carried out by Cardiff University and the University of Southampton, found that 70% of respondents were able to work at a level that was just as productive, if not more so while in a working from home situation. The study also found that productivity could be improved by a permanent shift towards remote working, with 9 out of 10 employees eager to continue working from home in some capacity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefits of not spending countless hours every day stuck in a petrol spewing car or a cramped and expensive train are obvious. These changes have also resulted in employees having the opportunity to become ‘<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56210579\">accidental savers’</a> for the first time, while also allowing more time for people to explore personal hobbies and interests, as well as spend valuable time with family. The changes have also helped improve sleep patterns for millions, generally resulting in a happier and harder working workforce. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent <a href=\"https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2020/09/talktalk-survey-claims-homeworking-boosts-uk-productivity.html#:~:text=A%20new%20survey%20commissioned%20by,network%20also%20remains%20above%20normal.\">survey</a> carried out by TalkTalk revealed that both employees and employers believe that remote working has had a positive impact on productivity. 58% of workers said they felt more productive when working from home, with 30% of business leaders agreeing with this assessment. In addition to this, 35% of leaders also stated that their employees were working more collaboratively from home, as opposed to in the office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned previously, the financial savings and positive environmental impact that came from reduced travelling (both international and local) has been massive. Busy commuter work areas such as Dheli and Manhattan have presented <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201208162957.htm\">preliminary data</a> that air quality had improved during the pandemic. In China, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdown_in_Hubei\">lockdowns</a> and other measures resulted in a 25 percent reduction in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas\">carbon emissions</a> and 50 percent reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions, which one <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_system_science\">Earth systems</a> scientist estimated may have saved at least 77,000 lives over two months. While overly optimistic stories of ‘<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/coronavirus-pandemic-fake-animal-viral-social-media-posts\">dolphins and swans returning to Venice</a>’ have been largely debunked as fake viral news, cities like Venice are using this opportunity to make badly needed environmental changes, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56592109#:~:text=On%20Wednesday%2C%20Italian%20ministers%20agreed,the%20historic%20St%20Mark\'s%20Square.&amp;text=Culture%20Minister%20Dario%20Franceschini%20hailed,decision%2C%20awaited%20for%20years%22.\">banning</a> of large cruise ships from the historic center to protect against further flooding and pollution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there appears to be many benefits to working from home for employees/employers and the environment, there has of course been a downside to these changes. While Governments and businesses are losing billions due to the exodus from the world’s city centres, the emotional toll has also had a sizable impact on many people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <a href=\"https://www.unbiased.co.uk/news/accountant/how-lockdown-upset-the-work-life-balance\">recent poll</a> suggested that 40% of UK employees already felt that work was seeping into their home life. But by August of 2020, this figure had shot up to 52%, showing the effect of widespread home working. Workers stated that some have found it difficult to switch off in the evenings, with a quarter of those polled stating that they are working longer hours when at home. For those people with young children, trying to balance home-schooling and childcare duties with remote working has also contributed to a decline in work-life balance. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Moving forward</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the world starts to come out of lockdown and hopefully return to a more ‘normal’ situation, what does this mean for those who have become accustomed to working from home? Many will be reluctant to return to the soul crushing daily commute and expense of travelling to an office, just to stare at the same computer monitor they have been using at home to great success for the past year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While home working has some issues and challenges that need to be addressed, a <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/economy/articles-reports/2020/09/22/most-workers-want-work-home-after-covid-19\">recent study</a> by YouGov suggested that many office employees will be reluctant to return back to the traditional 5 days a week of office work. The study stated that only 7% of office workers hope to return to the traditional full-time office working pattern, whilst 20% stated that their preferred option would be to work from home full-time, with 32% opting for a mix of office work and working from home, with the freedom and opportunity to work from home most days. This would allow for a day or two of office work per week in which to conduct face to face matters and build in personal relationships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever changes the future brings, it is clear that the Covid-19 pandemic has altered the way we live and work to a generational defining degree. Hopefully we will emerge from the experience wise and bolder in our attitudes and behaviour towards working environments and expectations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While continuing to work from home can still present challenges for many, we have learned some valuable lessons that can be implemented to help improve your home working experience. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Homeworking improvements </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Switching off when the work day is done</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main issues reported when home working is being able to separate your home office from your home. When they are the same place, it can be very difficult to mentally flip from work to home mode as the lines of your work/personal life can easily become blurred. This has given to the increased recommendation and use of a dedicated work area and the massive growth in popularity of garden shed offices. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/RXNU1287.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1097504\" src=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/RXNU1287.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"562\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Maintaining focus</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the issues people have struggled most with when working from home is dealing with the constant stream of potential interruptions. Family and children requiring attention and supervision, social media, noisy neighbours, pets, and the call of your smartphone are all doing their best to distract you from work. Setting up hard rules in order to maintain focus can be a difficult and bumpy ride for lots of new working from home employees. Many are still struggling to find a happy medium, even after a year. But as attitudes and work patterns change and start to become the accepted norm, people will learn to adapt fully and learn to block out all the distractions.  </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_308424155-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1097503\" src=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_308424155-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"407\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Work relationships</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is an inescapable fact that for better or worse, working from home can be a difficult </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and lonely experience for many people. For many, work colleagues are the only other people they interact with on a daily basis. When you have become accustomed to interacting with a large office full of people every day, suddenly finding yourself isolated &#8211; both professionally and personally &#8211; can be difficult to deal with. Keeping in touch with your work colleagues on both a professional and personal level can help you maintain a strong sense of being connected and part of a team. Slack chats, WhatsApp group chats, Zoom calls and email chains are all important ways to help you stay in touch while working from home.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/7b2ba3dd-d5f7-459c-aea0-80fedbf07d7a-shutterstock-1706740990.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1097502\" src=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/7b2ba3dd-d5f7-459c-aea0-80fedbf07d7a-shutterstock-1706740990.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/7b2ba3dd-d5f7-459c-aea0-80fedbf07d7a-shutterstock-1706740990.jpg 750w, https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/7b2ba3dd-d5f7-459c-aea0-80fedbf07d7a-shutterstock-1706740990-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Change Up Your Working Environment </b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of how well you set up your home work office and how free of distractions it is, looking at the same 4 walls everyday will have a monotonous and negative effect on anyone. </span><a href=\"https://www.usafact.com/the-workplace/changing-the-work-environment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your work environment has proved to help improve creativity and productivity.

Will companies continue to justify spending millions in property rentals and contribute massive amounts of Co2 emissions, when the great working from home experiment has shown that remote work is both sustainable and productive?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is likely that now the genie is ‘out of the bottle’, business leaders have realised that long held suspicions that ‘working from home = not working’ are unfounded. Partial or full home working will likely become the latest hard won workers&#8217; right (such as weekends off, sick pay, pensions, maternity leave, paid holidays etc.) to be an expected benefit for applicable jobs. While there will be many that will want to go back to the traditional 5 days in an office working environment, most will weigh up the financial savings and employee demands and continue to offer it as an option. In modern competitive working environments, it will also become essential to compete with other companies offering a home working option. This will likely result in the normalisation of a hybrid working pattern to accommodate employees eager to retain new working from home options afforded to them during the Covid crisis. </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://updraftplus.com/one-year-on-the-future-of-remote-working/\">One year on: The future of remote working</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://updraftplus.com\">UpdraftPlus</a>. <a href=\"http://updraftplus.com\">UpdraftPlus - Backup, restore and migration plugin for WordPress.</a></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://updraftplus.com/one-year-on-the-future-of-remote-working/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"Celebrate World Backup Day with UpdraftPlus\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/UpdraftPlus/~3/vU4m2ms_3YM/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 13:25:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"Other WordPress news\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"UpdraftPlus\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"world backup day\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://updraftplus.com/?p=1083848\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:735:\"<p>World Backup Day carries a lot of importance for UpdraftPlus.

While every day is World Backup Day for UpdraftPlus, March 31st serves as a reminder every year that we no longer have to take the very real risk of losing all these important files anymore. A simple backup with UpdraftPlus that takes just a few seconds, can keep your site and files safe for as long as you want them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As anyone who has ever used a computer, programme or online service for any period of time will know &#8211; crashes, failures, conflicts and viruses are a part of life. It usually isn’t a case of ‘will I encounter a problem?’, rather than ‘when will I encounter a problem?’</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can imagine, as an organisation that devotes so much time and effort to backups, we have heard countless stories down the years from people all over the world who have lost years of hugely important data and information that they have spent a lot of time and money developing. Thankfully, with UpdraftPlus installed, they were able to restore their site to a previous version and regain access to all their lost content. UpdraftPlus &#8211; the world’s leading WordPress backup plugin &#8211; can help you make sure that you never have to join the ranks of those unfortunate people who realised all too late, the importance of backing up your website. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.worldbackupday.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World Backup Day</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was started in 2001 by digital consultant, Ismail Jadun. This particular day was selected as it is the day before April Fool’s day. Ismail felt that people would associate the connection with April Fools Day, as it was hoped that potentially losing all your files and work would feel like being victim of a particularly bad prank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On March 31st, it is encouraged that people all over the world share the backup pledge: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;I solemnly swear to backup my important documents and precious memories on World Backup Day, March 31st.&#8221;</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UpdraftPlus has a range of backup packages to suit all of your backup needs. Installed by over 3 million users all over the world, our easy-to-use interface allows you to backup and restore your website with a single click. You can also set the schedule to backup automatically as often as you like, so you don’t have to worry about forgetting to backup your site manually and will always have a recent upload of your site ready to go &#8211; should the worst happen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Download </span><a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UpdraftPlus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> today for the most secure, reliable and highly rated WordPress backup plugin. </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://updraftplus.com/celebrate-world-backup-day-with-updraftplus/\">Celebrate World Backup Day with UpdraftPlus</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://updraftplus.com\">UpdraftPlus</a>. <a href=\"http://updraftplus.com\">UpdraftPlus - Backup, restore and migration plugin for WordPress.</a></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://updraftplus.com/celebrate-world-backup-day-with-updraftplus/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"How to fix UpdraftPlus failed backups\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/UpdraftPlus/~3/aw5mbIfQ90Q/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 15:01:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:8:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Tips and tricks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"broken\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"failing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"fix\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"not backing up\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"not completing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:7;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"UpdraftPlus\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://updraftplus.com/?p=1081727\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:738:\"<p>UpdraftPlus is the world’s leading and most popular WordPress backup plugin, with over 3 million active installs.

Users all over the world are using UpdraftPlus to safely and securely backup their WordPress sites, files and databases should they ever need to restore their site if the worst happens. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with any plugin, programme or piece of software, issues can arise when trying to carry out a function, such as when creating a backup. In this blog we will go through the most common reasons that you may be causing failed backups and how to fix them. </span><br />\n<b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Update plugin / Plugin conflict </b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably the most common issue a user of UpdraftPlus would run into is not having an up to date version of UpdraftPlus. While older versions will still work, problems and conflicts can be caused by not keeping your plugins up to date. If you are having a problem with the backup of your site not completing, always check to make sure you have the latest version of UpdraftPlus installed first.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-25T141521.022.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1081735\" src=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-25T141521.022.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"886\" height=\"182\" srcset=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-25T141521.022.jpg 886w, https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-25T141521.022-480x99.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 886px, 100vw\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue you could potentially face is if a new plugin you recently installed is causing a conflict with UpdraftPlus. Deactivate any new plugins and try backing up again. Common causes of conflicts are plugins loading their own versions of JavaScript libraries or cloud storage APIs on the UpdraftPlus page. These can prevent UpdraftPlus from starting a backup or uploading the backup files to remote storage.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Not connected to remote storage location / Remote storage full</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>An update to your remote storage location, such as a change of password or folder structure, could potentially be the cause of any issues you may be having, when trying to back up to remote storage.<b></b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To check if this could be the problem, try verifying and resaving your remote storage settings. For cloud storage services which use OAuth verification (such as Dropbox, OneDrive and Google Drive), you may need to re-authenticate with your storage account</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To reconnect to your remote storage location, go through the full ‘add remote storage’ option again at UpdraftPlus &gt; Settings. Here you can re-authenticate to your remote storage account of choice.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-25T144144.439.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1081733\" src=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-25T144144.439.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1108\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-25T144144.439.jpg 1108w, https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-25T144144.439-980x346.jpg 980w, https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-25T144144.439-480x169.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1108px, 100vw\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember to click the ‘Save changes’ button and then attempt another backup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with any remote storage location, there is a finite amount of space. The reason that your backup is failing to complete could be that there is not enough space for UpdraftPlus to save the files to. Check your remote storage space and delete files or purchase extra space if necessary.</span><b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Backup files too big &#8211; Reduce the backup archive split size to 100Mb or lower</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the above issues users of UpdraftPlus may encounter, such as not having the remote storage location properly setup, the most common technical reasons for a backup failing to complete is that you are trying to backup a file that is too large to upload or the file on the server is too large to process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the situation where the file is too large to upload, this can be caused by some plugins creating databases or files that are many hundreds of MB large. These large files can cause UpdraftPlus to time out and not complete the backup. You should always aim to reduce the backup archive split size to 100MG or lower if possible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To reduce the archive split size, open the ‘Expert settings’ section of the UpdraftPlus Settings tab.</span></p>\n<p><b><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1081732\" style=\"font-weight: 500;\" src=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-25T145321.440.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1108\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-25T145321.440.jpg 1108w, https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-25T145321.440-980x346.jpg 980w, https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-25T145321.440-480x169.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1108px, 100vw\" /></b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the ‘Split backups every’ option, set it to 100Mb. Remember to press the “Save changes” button at the bottom of the page and then run a test backup. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a large file on your site that cannot be split up as it is a single file (such as a large video file), it is recommended increasing the PHP time limit (and possibly memory limit)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To increase the PHP time limit, you need to edit the ‘wp-config.php’ file on your WordPress site. This file is located in your WordPress site’s root folder, which can be accessed via an FTP client or file manager in your web hosting control panel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open this file in a text editor, paste below code in the ‘wp-config.php’ file just before the line says ‘That’s all, stop editing! Happy blogging.’</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">set_time_limit(300);</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember to save your changes and upload the wp-config.php file back to your server. This new code will tell your server to increase the PHP time limit to 300 seconds.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-29T105914.344.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1081740\" src=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-29T105914.344.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"694\" height=\"445\" srcset=\"https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-29T105914.344.jpg 694w, https://updraftplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/New-Project-2021-03-29T105914.344-480x308.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 694px, 100vw\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Refresh your site and attempt another backup. You can increase the time limit again if needed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, you can also try increasing the memory limit. The process is very similar to the time limit and requires you  to edit the wp-config.php file on your WordPress site.

In order to ascertain what these may be, we would recommend that you ask the UpdraftPlus support team to investigate your PHP error logs. These logs will hopefully contain more information on the exact issues that are causing the non-completion of backup problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To find the file, you will need FTP access to the server for a PHP log (also applied to remote storage).

However we understand that there are many situations in which a licence may have only been used; temporarily on a test site or clone for example. If you purchased the Personal package, it could be possible to use both licences on testing sites for just a few hours and have no licences left when you are ready to install UpdraftPlus Premium on your main site.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We want to ensure that UpdraftPlus customers have the best experience possible when using our product. As such we now allow users to reset their license, so that they can be used on other websites and are not ‘locked’ to the first site it is used on.</span></p>\n<p><b>How to rest your licence</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 2 methods you can use if you wish to reset and reuse one of your UpdraftPlus licences.</span></p>\n<p><b>Method 1 &#8211; Self reset</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-service licence resets are now available from your account page.
